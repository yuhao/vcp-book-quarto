# Subsurface and Volume Scattering {#sec-chpt-mat-vs}

This chapter studies subsurface scattering and volume scattering.
While superficially different, they involve the same forms of light-matter interaction and are modeled in the same way.
We start with an example to build some useful intuitions, and then we will get into the weeds of modeling.
In our modeling, we start from modeling local events (absorbing and scattering photons by particles), from which we will build a general framework, called the Radiative Transfer Equation and its variant Volume Rendering Equation (VRE), to reason about subsurface and volume scattering globally.
Finally, we will connect VRE to (neural) radiance-field rendering, a modern iteration of image-based rendering (@sec-chpt-mat-basics-radiometry-lf) that uses VRE to parameterize the image formation process.

## An Informal Discussion to Build Intuition {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-ov}

Once inside the material (through surface refraction), a photon roams about until it meets a particle.
The interactions between photons and particles are governed by the subsurface scattering (SSS) or volume scattering processes.
As noted before, photon emission, absorption, and scattering all take place during the SSS/volume scattering processes, not just scattering, even though the names suggest otherwise.
We will generally ignore emission in our discussion unless otherwise noted, but just note that emission does happen and is correlated with absorption, since emission is the result of absorbed photons having (e.g., chemical) reactions with the particles.

Also a reminder that SSS and volume scattering are governed by exactly the same principles, because they are exactly the same thing.
In computer vision and graphics literature they might be used to refer to superficially different phenomena.
Volume scattering is concerned with materials that can be modeled as a volume of particles, like fog, clouds, and smoke;
they are given the name **participating media** in computer graphics.
SSS is, instead, more commonly used to refer to solids where subsurface-scattered photons contribute to their observed colors.

Subsurface scattering is so termed to distinguish itself from surface scattering, but what is beneath the surface is nothing more than a volume of particles.
In fact, what is above the surface is also a volume of particles.
Looking at @fig-photon_particle_interactions, the air, Material~1~, and Material~2~ can all be thought of as participating media.
We usually model the air as a vacuum so photons traverse in straight lines undisturbedly, but if we were to be exact, we would want to model the particles in the air, which becomes a participating medium.
So "above-surface scattering" is as different from as surface scattering as is subsurface scattering.

![At the Air-Material~1~ interface, photons are either reflected directly back or penetrate into the material through refraction. The refracted photons interact with the material particles through the volume scattering processes, where some photons are absorbed and others penetrate into Material~2~. For someone observing from the outside, a portion of the photons would eventually leave the material composite altogether and re-enter the air. Some of these leaving photons are called the back-scattered photons that contribute to the apparent surface reflectance; others transmit through the materials and contribute to the apparent transmittance of the material composite.](figs/photon_particle_interactions){#fig-photon_particle_interactions width="80%"}

### General Intuitions

We will use @fig-photon_particle_interactions as a running example to discuss the life of photons inside the material.
At the Air-Material 1 interface, photons are either reflected directly back or penetrate into the material through refraction.
When a refracted photon meets a particle, the particle might absorb the photon or scatter it away.
If absorbed, the photon is "dead" and can be removed from the discussion.
If scattered, the photon might appear to change its direction and continue to travel on a straight line until it meets another particle, so in principle a photon can be scattered multiple times.

There are three fates a photon eventually has to accept: 1) it might be absorbed along the way, 2) it might re-emerge from Material 1 back to the air, or 3) it might emerge to the air from the bottom of Material 2.
Absorption is easy to understand: a photon has a certain probability of being absorbed when it meets a particle, so the longer it travels, the more likely it will be absorbed.
Let's examine the other two cases where a photon escapes the media.

* After multiple scattering, some of the initial photons that enter Material 1 from the air will reach the Material 1-air boundary again, but this time from the material side.
At that point, the photons necessarily go through another round of reflection-refraction governed by the surface scattering processes.
The refracted photons will re-emerge from Material 1.

    This is called **back-scattering**, because these photons are scattered back to where they come.
As a consequence, when we observe the material from the same side of the illumination, the lights that enter our eye come from two sources: the initial surface scattering and the back-scattering.

* Some photons might leave Material 1 from the other side and enter Material 2, in which photons go through the same volume scattering processes, where some are absorbed, some can be turned back to Material 1, and some, critically, can hit the Air-Material 2 interface.
    Just like what happens at the Air-Material 1 interface, some of the photons will eventually emerge from Material 2.
    These photons essentially survive the absorption of all the particles in the media.
    When you observe the material from the opposite side of the illumination, it is these transmitted photons that dictate the color of the material.

Sometimes people will also say, "sub-surface scattering is caused by photons exiting at a point different from the incident point".
It points to the fact that a photon can re-emerge anywhere from the material after SSS, whereas surface scattering is *modeled* to be taking place only at the incident point (although we will see later that this is just a useful macroscopic abstraction or, rather, modeling strategy).

### Transparent vs. Opaque vs. Translucent Materials

We often hear materials being described as opaque, translucent, and transparent.
We can now more scientifically approach these terms given the intuitions we have built so far.

#### Transparent Materials

Transparent materials either scatter light predominantly in forward directions or they scatter very little light (other than surface scattering).
As a result, most photons traveling through the material are either absorbed or go through without changing much of their the directions.
So if you hold a transparent material against a light source, you can clearly see through the material and see the light on the other side.
This does not mean transparent materials always have the same color as the light source --- absorption could be wavelength-selective.
An example is aqueous/dye solutions where dye molecules are very small ($\sim nm$ range) and, thus, scatter little light so they look transparent, but depending on the absorption spectrum (which depends on how the dye molecules interact with molecules in the solvent), most dye solutions are not colorless.

#### Opaque Materials

In many materials, photons arriving at the material surface are either reflected right away at the surface or, for those that do penetrate into the materials, are all absorbed by the subsurface particles.
Examples include conductors like metals, whose subsurface absorption is very strong, or sufficiently thick dielectrics.
These materials are **opaque** in two senses.
First, their transmittance is practically 0.
Because of strong absorption, no photon re-emerges at the other side of the material.
If you hold, say, a brick (dielectric) against a light bulb, the brick would completely block the light.
Second, their reflectance is independent of the substrate or the material beneath them, so they completely hide the color of the substrate\footnote{Technically speaking, having a zero transmittance requires the material to have a stronger absorption than hiding the substrate, because in the latter case photons have to make a round trip, so they have more opportunities to be absorbed.}.
Painters know that if they want to cover a layer in their painting, they will need to apply a very thick layer of paint on top.

#### Translucent Materials

**Translucent** materials such as jade, wax, and human skin are neither opaque nor transparent.
If you hold wax against a light bulb, the wax will not completely block the light, so you will see some light, but you will not be able to see clearly the other side through the wax, since photons from the light bulb are very much volume-scattered after passing through the wax.
Clearly modeling SSS is critical for accurately estimating the color of translucent materials.
In fact, in graphics literature we sometimes see things like "modeling translucent material must consider sub-surface scattering".
In this sense, we might be tempted to classify participating media as translucent materials, because their colors certainly very much depend on volume scattering.
While it is technically correct, people rarely do that, perhaps just because of the weirdness of calling, say, smokes, a material rather than a medium?

It is *not* true that SSS is important only in modeling translucency.
Modeling SSS can be important for opaque materials.
Consider the wax case: what if we make the wax very thick?
The thick wax will eventually become opaque in that it will completely hide the material behind it.
But that does not mean volume scattering does not matter here; the back-scattered photons do contribute to the apparent color of a thick wax.

#### Oil Painting Example

To put things together, consider a painting.
One way paintings are characterized is by how they were painted, and we might see things like ``oil on canvas''.
Oil means the paint is oil paint, where paint pigments are dispersed into (usually linseed) oil, which is usually called the binder or the vehicle.
Canvas is the substrate, which is nothing more than another material that is right beneath the painting.

The oil itself is somewhat transparent, especially when you just apply a thin layer on the canvas.
But with the paint pigments, the entire oil paint becomes a translucent material.
When photons leave the oil paints, they immediately interact with the canvas.
If the paint layer is thick enough, virtually no photon can ever reach the canvas.
But if the paint is relatively thin, the property of the substrate will contribute to the overall color of the paint.
For instance, if the canvas is white-ish, a good percentage of the photons will be reflected back.
The same paint would look much darker if the canvas is black, which absorbs a lot of photons.

### Equilibrium

We can view the light-material interaction as a dynamical system under an equilibrium.
To appreciate this, consider again @fig-photon_particle_interactions.
Some photons entering Material 1 are back-scattered and hit the Air-Material 1 interface and some of those photons will re-enter Material 1 through internal reflection.
Those photons will then go through multiple scattering, and as a result some will be back-scattered again and hit the Air-Material 1 interface.
The cycle goes on.
The secondary back-scattering is weaker in power than the first back-scattering, and the third-order back-scattering is even weaker, and so on.
So eventually you can imagine that the total number of photons back-scattered at the surface will reach a constant.

In fact, this sort of dynamics takes place everywhere inside the material along every direction.
If you pick a point $p$ in the material (or at the surface) and a direction $\omega$ starting at the point, the radiance at ($p, \omega$) is a constant under equilibrium.
In other words, the spatial radiance distribution (a.k.a., the light field) is not changing over time.

The equilibrium is reached almost instantaneously, since light propagates incredibly fast.
So the equilibrium discussion is probably of no practical impact in modeling or actual measurement, but it is still important to keep this in mind.
The (spectral) reflectance/BRDF modeling/measurement is done assuming equilibrium, and later when we model volume scattering, we will set up the differential equations under the equilibrium assumption, too.

## Absorption {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-abs}

We will focus on modeling absorption in this chapter, and the way we build the models is fundamental to how scattering will be dealt with later.

### A Simple Case: Collimated Illumination on Uniform Medium {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-abs-simple}

Imagine that a beam of light hits a volume of particles.
The light is **collimated** in that all photons travel along the same direction.
We take a slice of the material perpendicular to the incident direction.
The slice is so thin that no particles in that material cover each other from the direction of the incident light.
This is shown in @fig-absorption_model (a).
We also, for now, assume that the medium is *uniform* in that the **number concentration** $c$ (i.e., the number of particles per unit volume) of each slice is exactly the same.

![Conceptual model to help reason about photon absorption. (a): the setting for calculating the radiance reduction over a very thin slice. (b): the radiance reduction over a finite length is calculated by accumulating the radiance reduction over infinitely many thin slices.](figs/absorption_model){#fig-absorption_model width="80%"}

Say the slice has a depth of $\D s$ and a geometrical cross-sectional area of $E$.
All the particles have the same geometrical cross-sectional area of $\epsilon_g$.
In the simplest model, a photon is absorbed whenever it hits a particle.
In reality, the chance of absorption can be higher or lower.
The *effective* area available for absorption is:

$$
\begin{align}
    \epsilon = \epsilon_g Q_a,
\end{align}
$$

where $Q_a$ is called the **absorption efficiency** and is usually smaller than 1 for molecules (which have small $\epsilon_g$) and greater than 1 for large particles (whose $\epsilon_g$ can be large).
$Q_a$ is wavelength dependent, so we should have written it as $Q_a(\lambda)$, but we will omit the wavelength in our notations for simplicity's sake.
In physics, $\epsilon$ is called the **absorption cross section** of the particle; it characterizes the intrinsic capability of a particle to absorb photons.
Mind the subtle but important difference between the geometrical cross-sectional area and the cross section of a particle.

The question we are interested in is, if the incident radiance is $L$, what is the radiance leaving the slice $L+\D L$?
By convention, $\D L$ is defined as the exitant radiance minus the incident radiance and, in this case, has to be negative.
The percentage of photons that are absorbed by this slice of particles ($-\frac{\D L}{L}$) is equivalent to the cross-sectional area of the slice that is covered by the total cross sections of the particles:

$$
\begin{align}
    -\frac{\D L}{L} &= \frac{cE\D s\epsilon}{E},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-abs_1}

where $c$ is the particle concentration of the slice, and $E\D s$ is the total volume of the slice.
So $cE\D s$ is the number of particles in this thin slice, and $cE\D s\epsilon$ is the total cross section of all the particles.
Given the assumption that no particles are covering each other, $\frac{cE\D l\epsilon}{E}$ is then the percentage of the thin slice's cross-sectional area that is available for photon absorption and, thus, the percentage of the incident photons that are absorbed.
The negative sign on the left-hand side of @eq-abs_1 signals the fact that $\D L$ is negative.

We rewrite @eq-abs_1 as @eq-abs_2:
$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\D L}{\D s} &= -c\epsilon L = -\sigma_a L,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-abs_2}

which shows that the amount of photon absorption per unit length ($\frac{\D L}{\D s}$) is proportional to the current amount of photons up to a scaling factor $c\epsilon$.
In the computer graphics literature, $c\epsilon$ is called the **absorption coefficient**, denoted $\sigma_a$.

#### Bouguer-Beer-Lambert's Law

When $\D s$ approaches infinity, we can rewrite @eq-abs_2 as a differential equation:

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\d L}{\d s} = \lim_{\D s \rightarrow 0}\frac{\D L}{\D s} = -\sigma_a L
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-abs_3}

This equation is a classic case of exponential decay, and its solution is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
    L(s) = L_0 e^{-\sigma_a s}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-abs_4}

where $L_0 = L(0)$ is the initial radiance of the light before interacting with the particles, as visualized in @fig-absorption_model (b), $L(s)$ denotes the radiance at a particular length $s$.

@eq-abs_4 allows us to calculate the remaining radiance after the light travels a length $s$.
@eq-abs_4 is called the **Bouguer-Beer-Lambert's law** (BBL), which is a geometrical optics' simplification of the electromagnetic theory of light-matter interaction where the matter is purely absorptive [@mayerhofer2020bouguer].


#### An Alternative Derivation

An equivalent way of deriving the BBL law is the following.
We divide the entire volume (with a total length of $s$) into $N$ thin slices, each with a length of $\D s$.
After the first slice, the surviving portion of the initial radiance is $L = L_0(1-\sigma_a \D s)$, so after going through all the $N$ slices, the remaining radiance is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
    L_N = L_0(1-\sigma_a \D s)^N = L_0(1-\sigma_a \frac{s}{N})^N.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-alt_abs_1}

Now when $\D s$ becomes infinitesimally small, $N$ approaches infinity, so the limit of the remaining radiance as a function of the total length $s$ is given in @eq-alt_abs_2, which is the same as @eq-abs_4.

$$
\begin{align}
    L(s) = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}L_0(1-\sigma_a \frac{s}{N})^N = L_0 e^{-\sigma_a s}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-alt_abs_2}

### Absorption Coefficient

The absorption coefficient is an important measure of the medium's ability to absorb photons.
It has a unit of $\text{m}^\text{-1}$, which means it is not bound by 0 and 1.
One way to interpret the absorption coefficient is to observe that $\sigma_a \d s = \d L/L$, which is the fraction of the radiance absorbed or the probability of light absorption by an infinitesimal slice.
So $\sigma_a = (\d L/L)/\d s$ can be interpreted as the probability *density* of photon absorption, i.e., the probability of absorption per unit length traveled:

$$
\begin{align}
    \sigma_a = \lim_{\D s \rightarrow 0} \frac{\D L}{L}/\D s = \frac{\d L}{L \d s}.
\end{align}
$$

Like any density measure, absorption coefficient is most useful when it is integrated: when we integrate $\sigma_a$ over the length that light travels, we get the fraction/percentage of the light absorbed.
One can also show that $1/\sigma_a$ is the expected value of the distance a photon can travel before being absorbed [@bohren2006fundamentals, Chpt. 5.1.3]; this quantity is given the name **mean free path** (l).
To derive $l$, observe that the probability that a photon is absorbed after traveling a distance $s$ is $1-e^{-\sigma_as}$.
So the probability *density* of absorption as a function of the distance $s$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
    f(s) = \frac{\text{d}(1-e^{-\sigma_a s})}{\text{d}s} = \sigma_ae^{-\sigma_a s}.
\end{align}
$$

So the expected value of $s$, which we can interpret as the distance a photon can travel on average before being absorbed, is:

$$
\begin{align}
    l = \int_0^\infty sf(s)\text{d}s = 1/\sigma_a.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-mfp}

### A Few Important Quantities {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-abs-quan}

We can now define a few other commonly used quantities (omitting the wavelength dependence for simplicity).
The **transmittance** $T$ of a volume with a total thickness of $s$ is defined as the percentage of the transmitted/unabsorbed photons after traveling the length of $s$ (@eq-trans):
$$
\begin{align}
    T = \frac{L(s)}{L_0} = e^{-\sigma_a s}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-trans}

The **absorbance** $A$ is the product of $\sigma_a s$:
$$
\begin{align}
    A = -\ln T = \ln\frac{L(s)}{L_0} = \sigma_a s.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-absorbance}

The **absorptance** $a$ of a volume is defined as the percentage of the absorbed photons by the volume, which relates to $T$ and $A$ by @eq-absorbance:
$$
\begin{align}
    a = 1 - T = 1 - e^{-A}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-absorptance}

We have seen these definitions in @sec-chpt-hvs-receptor-absorb-msp.
One very nice thing about the absorbance $A$ is that it is approximately equivalent to absorptance $a$ when $A$ is small (which would be true when, e.g., the length $s$ is very small, as is the case when discussing how a photoreceptor absorbs photons when illuminated transversely).

Another nice thing about absorbance is that absorbances add, because *absorption coefficients add*.
Imagine you have $n$ kinds of particles mixed up in a medium, each with a different absorption coefficient $\sigma_a^i$.
The overall absorbance of the medium is the sum of the individual absorbance $A^i$ derived as if the medium is made up of only one kind of particles.
That is:
$$
\begin{align}
    A = \sum_i^n A^i = s\sum_i^n\sigma_a^i = s\sum_i^n c^i\epsilon^i,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-absorbances_add}

where $c^i$ and $\epsilon^i$ are the concentration and absorption cross section of the $i^{th}$ particles.
Specifically, $c^i$ is defined as:
$$
\begin{align}
    c^i = \frac{n_i}{V},
\end{align}
$$

where $n_i$ is the number of the $i^{th}$ kind of particles in the material, and $V$ is the material volume.

This is not a surprising result.
As long as particles in a thin slice of this new heterogeneous medium do not cover each other, we can easily extend @eq-abs_1 and the rest of the derivation to consider multiple kinds of particles;
eventually @eq-absorbances_add would be a natural conclusion.
We will omit the derivation here for simplicity sake.

@eq-absorbances_add is a nice conclusion to have, because usually we *are* dealing with hybrid media.
For instance, paint is a mixture of binder particles and pigment particles, and a mist is a mixture of water droplets and air particles.
<!-- %\fixme{true to model this way? how to model a suspension of particles?} -->
If we do not want to model individual matters, we can use a single absorption coefficient to describe the aggregate behavior of the mixture.
That absorption coefficient does have a physical meaning: it is the concentration-weighted sum of the individual absorption coefficients.

There are a bunch of other quantities defined in the literature.
The state of the definitions is a bit of a mess, largely because different communities use different definitions.

* In visual neuroscience people sometimes use a quantity called **specific absorbance** (see, e.g., @bowmaker1980visual), which is the absorbance per unit length $\frac{A}{s}$.
Whenever you see a quantity that starts with the word "specific", chances are that the quantity is defined per unit length.
You can see that specific absorbance is actually just our absorption coefficient.

* In scientific communities, especially chemistry and spectroscopy, people define $\epsilon$, rather than $c\epsilon$, to be the absorption coefficient.
You can see the appeal of doing that --- $\epsilon$ is a more fundamental measure of a medium's ability to absorb photons, independent of the particle concentration $c$ (and certainly independent of the traversal length $s$).

* The absorbance defined in @eq-absorbance is technically called the **Naperian absorbance**, because we take the natural logarithm of $T$.
Sometimes people also use the **decadic absorbance**, which is defined as $-\log T$.
This quantity is also called the **optical density**.

* Finally, the number concentration $c$ here is defined in terms of the absolute quantity per unit volume, but sometimes people want to define $c$ as the **molar concentration**, which is the number of moles per unit volume.
If so, all other derived quantities are then prefixed with "molar".
Next time when you see something like the **molar decadic absorption coefficient**, you know what it is!

The annoying thing is that people do not always tell you which definition they use.
The plea I have to you is to be specific about which definition *you* use in your writing and tell me when I am being vague!

### General Case

So far we have assumed that the absorption coefficient $\sigma_a = c\epsilon$ is a constant regardless of the position $p$ in the medium and along any direction $\omega$.
The former property assumes that the medium is uniform, and
the latter property is called **isotropic**^["Isotropic" is a very overloaded term; it just means some physical property is invariant when measured from different directions. So depending on what physical property you care about, "isotropic" can mean different things.
The property we care about here is a volume's ability to absorb photons, which is different from our earlier use of isotropy, which is concerned with the ability of a surface to scatter photons.] in that the medium's ability to absorb photons is independent of the light direction.

Both assumptions are problematic in practice.
The concentration can change spatially and should be denoted $c(p)$, where $p$ is an arbitrary position in space.
$\epsilon$ can also change with $p$ and, more importantly, change with the direction of light incidence $\omega$.
For instance, the particles might not be spherical, so their geometrical cross-sectional area and, thus, the cross section $\epsilon$ available for absorbing photons can depend on $\omega$.
As a result, the absorption coefficient should generally be denoted $\sigma_a(p, \omega)$.

![A conceptual model to help reason about photon absorption in the general case, where the absorption coefficient can vary spatially and directionally. The medium is divided into many tiny elemental volumes, each of which is so small that particles do not cover each from any direction.](figs/absorption_model_general){#fig-absorption_model_general width="60%"}

Effectively, our conceptual model, shown in \Fig{fig:absorption_model_general}, has to be changed to one where the entire body of particles is divided into many equally-sized volumes (with a length $\D s$ and an area $\D A$), each of which is so small that particles do not cover each other from any direction.
The radiance reduction per unit length in a small volume is then expressed as:

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\D L(p, \omega)}{\D s} = -\sigma_a(p, \omega)L.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-abs_dif_cont}

Given this model, we can calculate the exitant radiance after light travels a length $s$ through the medium:

$$
\begin{align}
    L(p+s\omega, \omega) = L(p, \omega) e^{-\int_0^s \sigma_a(p+t\omega, \omega) \d t},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-abs_cont}

\noindent where $\omega$ is the (unit) direction of the incident radiance, $L(p, \omega)$ is the incident radiance, and $L(p+s\omega, \omega)$ is the exitance radiance (radiance toward $\omega$ leaving the entire medium after traveling $s$).

You would notice that for a beam with an oblique incident direction, the distance traveled, say $\D s'$, can be different (longer or shorter than) from $\D s$.
Our model can account for this by folding the factor $\D s'/\D s$ specific to a particular direction $\omega'$ into the absorption coefficient $\sigma_a(p, \omega')$.
Note that the $\D s'/\D s$ factor should be the average for all the incident photons with the same direction $\omega'$ across the entire $\D A$.

### Nature and Applicability of the Model

The absorption model (the BBL law) derived before (@eq-abs_4 and @eq-abs_cont) is a continuous one, but it is derived based on modeling discrete particles and events.
It is another example of the modeling methodology discussed on @sec-chpt-mat-ss-para-model.

@eq-abs_cont seems to suggest that absorption coefficient $\sigma_a(p, \omega)$ is continuously defined at any position $p$ in the medium along any direction $\omega$.
It is not true.
For starters, concentration $c$ is not continuous.
Rather, it exhibits the triphasic profile shown in @fig-model_scale.
As we keep shrinking the size of the volume to the molecular scale, eventually the concentration depends on whether the tiny volume contains any molecules or not, so it becomes wildly discontinuous, not to mention the headache of dealing with a partial molecule in a volume --- should it be counted or not?
In general, the absorption coefficient can be an arbitrary discontinuous function that is not integrable.

What about @eq-abs_4 where the absorption coefficient is uniform so we do not have to take the integral?
Well, that is a lie too: concentration is not continuous, so it cannot be uniform everywhere, and, by extension, the absorption coefficient cannot be a constant everywhere either.
So @eq-abs_3 is technically wrong when we let $\D s \rightarrow 0$ (i.e., $N \rightarrow \infty$), which is necessary for us to construct the differential equation (or take the limit in @eq-alt_abs_2).
For @eq-abs_3 to be true, the concentration/absorption coefficient must be a constant everywhere, which can be true only if the volume is continuous.

What has to happen is that the limit of $\D s$ cannot be literally 0 and the limit of $N$ cannot be infinity.
What we do is to keep reducing $\D s$ to the point where the concentration (and thus absorption coefficient) is insensitive to slight perturbation of $\D s$ (i.e., operating in the stable range in @fig-model_scale), and call it the concentration/absorption coefficient of that specific $\D s$.
And we repeat this for all the $\D s$.
This certainly applies to the general-case models in @eq-abs_dif_cont and @eq-abs_cont, where we iterate over not the thin slices $\D s$ but all the tiny volumes ($\D A \times \D s$).
So all the integral symbols are secretly summing over an extremely fine-grained grid.

How big of an error are we introducing here?
Technically, we should sum all $N$ slices across the total traversal length $s$ in @eq-alt_abs_1.
If we assume $\D s$ to be very small (even though not infinitesimal) compared to $s$, $N$ would be large, so taking the integration (equivalent to letting $N \rightarrow \infty$) would be very close to summing over $N$.
Similarly, the integral in \Eqn{eq:abs_cont} should have been a summation of the concentration in each of the $N$ slices.
If you want to be pedantic, however, the integration there is exact: we can model $c$ as a piece-wise function, where the value at each piece is the concentration of the corresponding volume.
Integrating over a piece-wise function is the same as summing all the pieces.
Only the exponential expression in @eq-abs_cont is inexact.

The discontinuity of the medium is, of course, orthogonal to the discontinuity and non-uniformity in the light field itself.
For instance, the fact that we use $\frac{cE\D l\epsilon}{E}$ as the percentage of photon absorption in @eq-abs_1 (and implicitly in @eq-abs_4) assumes that the irradiance of the incident illumination is continuous and uniform in the small volume.
This is technically not true because photons are discrete packets of energy.
But in practice this is not a concern because we can assume that there is an enormous amount of photons incident on the small volume, and these photons are randomly distributed.
<!-- %on the same point, Bohren p. 110 ``Implicit in the definition of cross sections is that the irradiance of the incident illumination be constant over lateral dimensions large compared with the size of the particle.'' -->

In essence, we are using the aggregated behavior of many photons to model the behavior of a small volume.
This is similar to the microfacet models, where we use the aggregated behavior of many microfacets to statistically model the behavior of a small macro-surface.

This sort of modeling strategy is a weird case where the discrete model provides the "ground truth", which is approximated by a continuous model.
I say ground truth --- to the extent that the geometrical optics can approximate the electromagnetic theory of light-matter interaction.
The BBL law fails when the wave nature of photons has to be considered [@mayerhofer2020bouguer].

## Scattering {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca}

Scattering is much more difficult to reason about than absorption, primarily because a scattered photon is not "dead" and continues to participate in light-matter interaction.
The way to study scattering is to first understand the behavior of a single scattering event and then consider the overall behavior of a large of collection of particles.

This section focuses a single scattering event (@sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single), and the next section discusses the general case where a large collection of particles interacts with photons.
Before all these, though, it is useful to first build some intuitions as to why there is a distinction between a single scattering event and scattering by a particle collection and explicitly lay out the assumptions made for the rest of our discussions (@sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-intuition).

### Scattering by a Particle vs. a Collection of Particles {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-intuition}

In geometric optics terms, scattering can be thought of as an event that takes place between a photon and a particle.
In the real world, however, objects and media are usually made of a large collection of particles, which introduces two complications: multiple scattering and interference.

#### Multiple Scattering

First, it is possible that a scattered photon, after traveling a certain distance, meets another particle and gets scattered again.
This makes it considerably more difficult to analyze the effect of scattering by a medium than does the scattering of a single particle.

![Left: The atmospheric scattering of the sand coming from the Sahara during Harmattan glows in the sun and gives a hazy view of the remote mountains. Nigeria's National Mosque is in the foreground; from \citet{haze}. Right: illustrations of the glow of the sun and the haze. Both are due to scattering, and the difference is purely visual but not fundamental.](figs/haze_scattering){#fig-haze_scattering width="100%"}

Look at @fig-haze_scattering (left) taken during Harmattan, where the atmosphere is full of sand and dust blown from the Sahara.
The large collection of particles in the atmosphere scatters light, glowing the sun and giving the remote mountains a hazy view.
The right panel illustrates the scattering events that give rise to the glow and the haze.

Without scattering, sunlight enters the eye directly.
With scattering, some photons from the sun are first knocked out of the view and could potentially be then scattered again back to the eye.
Some photons that enter the eye might even come from nearby objects other than the sun.
The scattering creates a glow around the sun, and, for the observer, the sun appears larger than it actually is.
The hazy view of the mountains is created by exactly the same scattering processes.
The photons that enter the eyes are mixed up from different parts of the mountains and from other objects.
The mountains appear hazy rather than glowing as the sun does simply because the sun has a higher brightness contrast against the background than does a region on the mountain.
So the distinction between "glow" and "haze" is nothing more than a visual difference at a superficial level rather than anything deeper in physics.

You can see why multiple scattering by large collections of particles poses challenges to our analysis.
If a photon is scattered once in the medium, the only effect of scattering would be to knock photons out of our line of sight, and thus, remote objects would only look dimmer rather than hazy.
In this case, scattering would function exactly like absorption, for modeling purposes at least.
With multiple scattering, we have to track not only photons that are scattered out but also photons that are scattered into the rays that enter our eyes^[Technically photons from other objects can enter our eye through a single-scattering event; see the discussion at the end.].
This is a daunting task considering that we are usually dealing with millions of particles and billions of photons, if not more.

If you want to be absolutely pedantic, we can distinguish the following cases:

* a single scattering event, where a photon meets a particle and is scattered away;
* single scattering, where a photon is scattered *once* by a medium (a large collection of photons), which is under
    * a collimated illumination, so the radiance of a ray can only be weakened because photons are scattered to other directions,
    * an arbitrary illumination, so the radiance of a ray can be both weakened and augmented (by photons scattered from other directions);
* multiple scattering, where a photon is scattered *multiple times* by a medium, so the radiance of a ray can both be weakened and augmented.

@sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single studies Case 1 and Case 2(a) together, because the latter is the statistical consequence of the former.
@sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte studies Case 2(b) and Case 3 together because they have the same observable effects and, thus, are modeled in the same way.

#### Interference and Coherence

Second, when there is a large collection of particles, the scattered radiation fields of individual particles can interfere with each other.
The exact impact of interference can only be calculated by considering the wave nature of the light.
But to the first order, the inference depends on how densely packed the particles are.

In fact, the specular surface scattering we discussed in @sec-chpt-mat-ss-mat is just a macroscopic approximation of the microscopic volume scattering where particles interfere non-randomly.
In a mirror or a glass of water, the particles/molecules are very densely packed to the point that the distance between two particles is smaller than the wavelength of the light.
As a result, the scattering is *coherent*, which gives rise to the *illusion* of a specular surface.
One can show that the Fresnel equations are the solution to the Maxwell's equations when surface particles are densely packed.

Why would the particle density matter?
If particles are very close to each other, their radiation fields are close too, so the interference is stronger and cannot be ignored.
More importantly, when particles are close to each other, their spatial positions can no longer be treated as random, so the interference can become coherent.
Imagine you drop particles into a vast empty space; the particle sizes are much smaller relative to the space, so their spatial distribution can be roughly described as random.
But if the particles are very densely packed, where the next particle can be is very much restrained, so their positions are highly correlated, leading to coherent scattering.

We will generally assume **incoherent scattering** unless otherwise noted, where individual scattering events interfere each other in random ways, so we are spared of the complication of thinking of the wave nature of the photons.
Under this assumption, the total power scattered by a collection of particles is the same as the sum of the power scattered by the individual particles.
This happens when the particles are sufficient sufficiently distant (separated by more than multiple wavelengths) and their spatial arrangements are uncorrelated.

<!-- %according to bohren and huffman p. 9, it's possible that particles are sufficiently apart but they are still not randomly positioned so their scattered fields can still interfere in a coherent way.
%when they say single scattering, they just mean particles are very apart, and their multiple scattering means particles are close.
%this definition is technically precise but can be weird since if particles are apart even if they interfere the effect is weak.
%so in our definition (and many others) here we assume that incoherent scattering means particles are both sufficiently apart and sufficiently randomly positioned so that individual scatterings are independent of each other. -->

### A Single Scattering Event {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single}

#### Scattering Efficiency and Coefficient {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single-coeff}

Intuitively, scattering has a similar effect as absorption: it weakens the radiance by taking photons away from a beam of light.
The difference is that scattered photons are not dead; they are re-directed to other directions.
We can define two important quantities, one to characterize a *particle*'s ability to scatter photons and the other to characterize a *medium*'s ability to scatter photons.

Similar to the situation in absorption, the intrinsic capability of a particle to scatter photons is defined by the particle's **scattering cross section** $\epsilon_s$, which itself is the product of the geometrical cross-sectional area of the particle $\epsilon_g$ and the **scattering efficiency** $Q_s$.
We can then define the **scattering coefficient** $\sigma_s$ of a medium (a large collection of particles), which characterizes the ability of the medium to scatter photons away from its incident radiance.
$\sigma_s$ is the product of the particle concentration of the medium $c$ and the particle's scattering cross section $\epsilon_s$.
Again, $\sigma_s$ has a unit $\text{m}^\text{-1}$ and is not bound by 0 and 1; it is best interpreted as the probability density (i.e., probability per unit length) of light being scattered away.
Of course, both the scattering efficiency and scattering coefficient can vary spatially, angularly, and spectrally.

The effects of scattering and absorption add up, because they both weaken a radiance.
We can extend @eq-abs_cont to consider scattering (again omitting the wavelength from the equations):

$$
\begin{align}
    L(p+s\omega, \omega) = L(p, \omega) e^{-\int_0^s (\sigma_a(p+t\omega, \omega) + \sigma_s(p+t\omega, \omega)) \d t},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-scat_cont}

where $\sigma_s(p, \omega)$ is the scattering coefficient at $p$ toward the direction $\omega$.

Rearranging the terms, we can express the **transmittance** between $p$ and $p+s\omega$ along the direction $\omega$, denoted $T(p \rightarrow p+s\omega)$:
$$
\begin{align}
    T(p \rightarrow p+s\omega) = \frac{L(p+s\omega, \omega)}{L(p, \omega)} = e^{-\int_0^s (\sigma_a(p+t\omega, \omega) + \sigma_s(p+t\omega, \omega)) \d t}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-transmittance}

@eq-scat_cont can be derived using the same idea as that used for deriving the absorption equation in @sec-chpt-mat-vs-abs-simple by modeling a thin layer $\D x$ --- with an additional assumption that $\D x$ is so thin that a photon is scattered at most once before leaving $\D x$.
Therefore, scattering by a single particle has the same effect as absorption: they both take the photon out of the radiance, and that is why the absorption equation (@eq-abs_cont) can be directly extended here.

Think of the applicability of @eq-scat_cont: it says that the radiance of a ray can only be weakened.
If the incident light has only one direction (e.g., a collimated beam), @eq-scat_cont is true when a photon is scattered at most once in the medium.
This is because a scattered photon will not have a chance to get back to the ray.
If the incident light is not mono-directional, e.g., diffuse illumination, @eq-scat_cont in general does not apply --- even if we consider only single scattering.
This is because photons originally not along the direction $\omega$ can be scattered toward it through just one single scattering event.
We can see how limited @eq-scat_cont is: it applies only when the illumination is collimated and we assume only single scattering.
We will relax this constraint later.
<!-- %same as the text above Equ 3.108 in Bohren. -->

Just like the absorption case (@eq-absorbances_add), if a medium is mixed with different particles, each with a different scattering coefficient, the overall scattering coefficient is the sum of the individual scattering coefficients as if the medium is made up of a particular kind of particles.

The sum of the scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient is called the **extinction coefficient** or **attenuation coefficient**, denoted $\sigma_t(p, \omega)$:

$$
\begin{align}
    \sigma_t(p, \omega) = \sigma_a(p, \omega) + \sigma_s(p, \omega).
\end{align}
$$

The ratio between the scattering coefficient and the attenuation coefficient is called the **single-scattering albedo** of the medium:

$$
\begin{align}
    \rho = \frac{\sigma_s(p, \omega)}{\sigma_t(p, \omega)}.
\end{align}
$$

This albedo can be seen as the volumetric counterpart of the surface albedo discussed in @eq-albedo_1.
The two forms of albedo have the same physical meaning: the fraction of the incident energy that is scattered away (i.e., not absorbed).
A dark medium (e.g., smoke) has a lower albedo, and a bright medium (e.g., mist) has a higher albedo.

The sum of the scattering and absorption cross sections is called the **extinction cross section** or **attenuation cross section**, denoted $\epsilon_t = \epsilon_a + \epsilon_s$.
And of course $1/\sigma_t$ is the mean free path in a medium where both absorption and scattering take place, i.e., the mean distance a photon can travel without being absorbed or scattered away.

### Scattering Direction Distribution: Phase Function {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single-pf}

While the scattering efficiency (coefficient) characterizes how well a particle (medium) is able to scatter photons, it tells us nothing about the *direction* of scattering.
The direction of a single scattering event is characterized by the **phase function** $f_p(p, \os, \oi)$, which can be interpreted as the probability *density* function that a photon incident from a direction $\oi$ is scattered toward a direction $\os$.
We will omit $p$ and write the phase function as $f_p(\os, \oi)$ when the discussion is unconcerned of $p$.

$f_p(\os, \oi)$ is defined as the fraction of the irradiance incident from an infinitesimal solid angle $\doi$ that is scattered toward an infinitesimal solid angle $\dos$ per unit solid angle:

$$
\begin{align}
    f_p(\os, \oi) = \lim_{\Dos \rightarrow 0} \lim_{\Doi \rightarrow 0} \frac{\D E_o(\os)}{\D E_i(\oi)} / \Dos = \frac{\d^2 E_o(\os)}{\d E_i(\oi)\dos} = \frac{\d^2 E_o(\os)}{L(\oi) \doi \dos}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-phase_func_def}

$\D E_i(\oi)$ is the incident irradiance over a small solid angle $\Doi$ and scatters in all directions.
$\D E_o(\oi)$ is the outgoing irradiance over a small solid angle $\Dos$, so $\frac{\D E_o(\os)}{\D E_i(\oi)}$ is the fraction of the photons incident from $\Doi$ that are scattered over $\Dos$ or, alternatively, the probability that a photon incident from $\Doi$ is scattered toward $\Dos$; this ratio/fraction is clearly a value between 0 and 1.
Dividing that fraction by $\Dos$ gets us the probability per unit solid angle.
When both the incident solid angle $\Doi$ and the outgoing solid angle $\Dos$ approach 0, the fraction can be interpreted as the directional-directional reflectance (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-reflectance), and the probability per solid angle within $\Dos$ becomes the probability *density* toward $\os$.

Like all density functions, the meaning of a phase function is most clear when it is integrated to compute some other quantity.
Integrating @eq-phase_func_def over all the outgoing directions $\os$:

$$
\begin{align}
    \d E_o &= \int^{\Omega = 4\pi} f_p(\os, \oi)L(\oi)\doi\dos \label{eq:energy_con_phase_func_1a} \\
    &= L(\oi)\doi\int^{\Omega = 4\pi} f_p(\os, \oi)\dos \label{eq:energy_con_phase_func_1b} \\
    &= \d E_i\int^{\Omega = 4\pi} f_p(\os, \oi)\dos \label{eq:energy_con_phase_func_1c}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-energy_con_phase_func_1}

To interpret this integration, consider a point that receives an incident radiance of $L(\oi)$ over an infinitesimal solid angle $\doi$.
The point receives a total irradiance of $\d E_i = L(\oi)\doi$, which is scattered in all directions.
The density of the irradiance scattered toward a particular direction $\os$ is $f_p(\os, \oi)L(\oi)\doi$^[A direction $\os$ has a solid angle of 0, so its associated irradiance is technically 0, too.  What $f_p(\os, \oi)L(\oi)\doi$ represents is the irradiance per solid angle.], which when multiplied by $\dos$ gives us the actual irradiance scattered over a small solid angle $\dos$ around $\os$.
Integrating all outgoing directions over the entire sphere ($4\pi$) we have @eq-energy_con_phase_func_1.

Now, of course, some of the photons in $\d E_i$ might not be scattered; they could be absorbed, or they could simply not hit the cross section of any particle.
So technically $\d E_o \leq \d E_i$ in @eq-energy_con_phase_func_1, just like how energy conservation is expressed in surface scattering in @eq-energy_con_1.
By the convention in the volume scattering literature, however, the phase function is defined such that $\d E_i$ refers to only the portion of the incident irradiance that does get scattered.
Therefore, $\d E_o = \d E_i$, so we have:

$$
\begin{align}
    \int^{\Omega = 4\pi} f_p(\os, \oi) \dos = \int^{\Omega = 4\pi} f_p(\os, \oi) \doi = 1.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-energy_con_phase_func_2}

That is, the phase function integrates to 1; the second integral can be derived using the Helmholtz reciprocity (since we are still dealing with geometrical optics):

$$
\begin{align}
    f_p(\oi, \os) = f_p(\os, \oi).
\end{align}
$$

One way to interpret the fact that the phase function integrates to 1 is that the phase function is the *conditional* probability density function of scattering: given that a photon is scattered, what is the probability (density) of scattering to a particular direction?

#### Phase Function vs. BRDF

The phase function can be seen as the volumetric counterpart (in the sense that we are talking about volume scattering) of BRDF (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-brdf) --- with two differences.
First, the definition of the BRDF accounts for absorption, so the BRDF integrates to *at most* 1, whereas the integral of the phase function is normalized to 1.
This difference in definition is born purely of convention.

The second difference is more fundamental.
There is no $\cos\theta$ term when using the phase function; see, e.g., @eq-energy_con_phase_func_1, unlike how the BRDF is used to turn irradiance into radiance (e.g., @eq-energy_con_1).
In fact, from @eq-energy_con_phase_func_1 we can see that given a radiance $L(\oi)$ and a solid angle $\doi$, the irradiance is simply $L(\oi)\doi$ rather than $L(\oi)\cos\theta_i\doi$.
Didn't we say that there is a cosine fall-off between radiance and irradiance (@sec-chpt-mat-basics-radiometry-radiance)?

One intuition that might help is that in volume scattering we are dealing with points, which can receive flux from the entire sphere and have no definition of a normal (because points are dimensionless and shapeless) or, perhaps more conveniently, have a "flexible" normal that changes with the illumination direction and is always facing directly at the illumination.
Entertain this thought experiment.
We set up a small surface detector at a point and measure the power of the detector;
if the incident light is parallel to the surface, the detector would receive no power, but would you say that the *point* does not receive any light and that the radiation field has no power?
Of course not.

The fact that a parallel surface would receive no photons absolutely does not mean the illumination has no power; the radiation field is the same whether it is illuminating a surface or illuminating a point.
But if we are modeling a surface, we *want* our model to say that the power received by the surface is 0, because it matches our phenomenological observation (that a detector arranged that way would receive no recording); when we are modeling a point in volume scattering, we *want* the point to receive a power as if the point has a "normal" that is directly facing the illumination because, again, this matches our phenomenological observation.

Ultimately, the difference is a conscious choice of modeling strategy even though the underlying physics is exactly the same.
That is why models based on BRDF and phase function are phenomenological models.
If you deal with electromagnetic theories and QED, you would not have to have this distinction between modeling surface and volume scattering.

With the understanding that there is no cosine fall-off in volume scattering, @eq-phase_func_def can be re-written as:

$$
\begin{align}
    f_p(\os, \oi) = \frac{\d^2 E_o(\os)}{\d E_i(\oi)\dos} = \frac{\d}{\d E_i(\oi)}\frac{\d E_o(\os)}{\dos} = \frac{\d L_o(\os)}{\d E_i(\oi)} = \frac{\d L_o(\os)}{L_i(\oi)\doi},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-phase_func_def2}

where $\d L_o(\os)$ is the infinitesimal outgoing radiance toward $\os$.
In this sense, the phase function operates in exactly the same way as the BRDF (@eq-brdf): they both operate on irradiance and turn infinitesimal irradiance into infinitesimal radiance.

#### Isotropic Medium and Isotropic Scatters {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single-pf-iso}

Given the normalization in the phase function, the scattering efficiency should actually be parameterized as $\bar{Q_s}(p, \os, \oi)$:

$$
\begin{align}
    \bar{Q_s}(p, \os, \oi) = Q_s(p, \oi) f_p(p, \os, \oi),
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-sca_eff_phase}

where $Q_s(p, \oi)$ should be be interpreted as the *total* scattering efficiency at $p$ over all outgoing directions for a given incident direction $\oi$.
Similarly, the scattering coefficient would be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align}
    \bar{\sigma_s}(p, \os, \oi) = \sigma_s(p, \oi) f_p(p, \os, \oi),
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-sca_coeff_phase}

where $\sigma_s(p, \oi)$ is interpreted as the *total* scattering coefficient at $p$ over all outgoing directions for a given incident direction $\oi$.

![Visualizations of common phase functions; adapted from @novak2018monte, where $\omega$ and $\bar\omega$ are the incident direction $\oi$ and the outgoing direction $\os$ in our notation, respectively. For an isotropic medium, the phase function depends on only the angle $\theta$ subtended by $\omega$ and $\omega'$ and is axially symmetric about $\omega$.](figs/phase_function.png){#fig-phase_function width="100%"}

@fig-phase_function visualizes a few common phase functions.
While $f_p(\cdot)$ is technically a 4D function parameterized by $\os$ and $\oi$, the phase function of many natural media is 1D and depends only on the angle $\theta$ subtended by $\os$ and $\oi$.
In @fig-phase_function, the distance of a point on the contour to the center represents the magnitude of the phase function at that particular $\theta$
Consider under what conditions this simplification can be true:

* First, it says that the phase function does not depend on the absolute incident direction $\oi$ but the relative angle between $\oi$ and $\os$.
To get a visual intuition, see @fig-phase_function_isotropic; if the phase function is invariant to the photon incident direction $\oi$, we can, without losing any generality, assign $\oi$ to the $z$-axis; the scattered direction $\os$ is parameterized by $\theta$ and $\phi$.
* Second, it also says the phase function depends on only $\theta$ but not $\phi$.
That is, the phase function is rotationally symmetric about the incident direction $\oi$.
So $f_p(\os, \oi) = f_p(\os', \oi) \neq f_p(\os'', \oi)$.

![The phase function of a spherical particle is 1) invariant to the incident direction $\oi$, which, without losing generality, is taken to be the $z$-axis here, and 2) also invariant to the azimuthal angle $\phi$ of the outgoing direction $\os$ but depends on the polar angle $\theta$. So $f_p(\os, \oi) = f_p(\os', \oi) \neq f_p(\os'', \oi)$. Media consisting of such particles are called isotropic media, but it does not mean the particle itself is an isotropic scatterer, which does not exist, but if it did, its phase function would be a constant (invariant to both $\theta$ and $\phi$).](figs/phase_function_isotropic){#fig-phase_function_isotropic width="50%"}

Intuitively, the phase function has the following two properties:

* If you fix the incident direction, no matter how you rotate the particle, the phase function distribution is the same.
Alternatively, if you change the incident direction, the phase function distribution moves along with the incident direction.
* Given an incident direction, the phase function distribution is axially symmetric about the incident direction.

The two conditions above are met only when the medium consists of randomly distributed spherically symmetric particles^[or when the medium consists of randomly distributed and oriented spherically asymmetric particles, in which case the medium is *statistically* spherically symmetric.], in which case 1) there is no reason to think that any incident direction is special, so the phase function certainly is invariant to $\oi$, and 2) there is no reason to think $\os$ and $\os'$ are any different since one should not expect the scattering behavior to change if we rotate the sphere about the incident direction ($z$-axis).

A medium consisting of spherically symmetric particles is called a *symmetric* or an **isotropic medium**.
Usually when we refer to an isotropic medium, not only is the phase function but also the total scattering coefficient $\sigma_s(p, \oi)$ (@eq-sca_coeff_phase) rotationally invariant to the incident direction^[In theory, it is certainly possible to have a medium whose total scattering coefficient/efficiency varies with the incident direction but not the angular distribution/probability of the scattered photons.].

As we said earlier, "isotropic" is an unbelievably overloaded term.
People also call a particle an **isotropic scatterer** if its phase function is a constant, i.e., invariant to $\os$; such a phase function is sometimes called an *isotropic phase function*.
An isotropic scatterer does not exist; it is a purely theoretical construction, but if it existed, its phase function would take the value of $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ given @eq-energy_con_phase_func_2, as shown in the first graph in @fig-phase_function.

### Common Models and General "Rules" {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-models}

There are many factors that determine the exact scattering efficiency and scattering direction, which can be calculated by solving the Maxwell's equations.
We will talk about a few common models here; we focus on the intuitions while omitting the exact mathematical expressions, which can be found in standard texts.
From the models, we can identify a few general "rules" or, rather, approximations under certain assumptions.

The main theory or model for a single scattering event is called the **Mie scattering** theory, which, strictly speaking, applies only when the particle is spherical [@sharma2003color, Chpt. 3.5.2; @bohren2006fundamentals, Chpt 3.5; @melbourne2004radio, Chpt. 3].
Mie scattering is *not* somehow a different scattering process from any other scattering, and the Mie theory is nothing more than the solution to the Maxwell's equations under certain conditions^[The modern form of the solution is summarized, not invented, by Gustav Mie but the solution had been developed by many predecessors such as Ludvig Lorenz.].

The Mie theory predicts that the overall scattering efficiency $Q_s$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
    Q_s &= \frac{8}{3}\gamma^4\big(\frac{m^2-1}{m^2+2}\big)\big[1+\frac{6}{5}\big(\frac{m^2-1}{m^2+2}\big)\gamma^2 + \cdots \big]\\
    \gamma &= \frac{r}{\lambda_m}, \\
    m &= \frac{n}{n_m},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-mie_1}

where $m$ is the the relative refractive index between the particle and the medium surrounding the particle, and $\gamma$ is the ratio between the particle radius $r$ and the incident light wavelength in the surrounding medium $\lambda_m$.
The notion of surrounding media might come across as a little surprising: doesn't the material consist merely of its particles?
Hardly.
For instance, in paints, pigments are surrounded by binders (e.g., linseed oil in oil paints, egg yolk in tempera paints, and beeswax in encaustic paints) and usually some amount of water (except oil paints).
When paint dries, some water might be evaporated, leaving pockets of air, which also contributes to the surrounding media.

We can draw a few general conclusions from the model.

#### Small-Particle (Rayleigh) Scattering

For small particles where $\gamma \ll 1$ (generally when the radius is ten times smaller than the wavelength of the incident light), only the first term in @eq-mie_1's bracket matters, so the scattering efficiency is inversely proportional to $\lambda_m^{-4}$.
The inverse proportionality to $\lambda_m^{-4}$ *largely* (but apparently not entirely) explains why the sky is blue and why the sun is red [@bohren2006fundamentals, Chpt. 8.1].
Why?
First, recognize that individual molecules, such as air molecules, are usually sub-nm in size, so they scatter in this small-particle regime.
Short wavelength lights from the sun are scattered by the atmospheric molecules more toward the sky and eventually enter your eyes, so if you look at the sky (against the sun) it would appear blue; when you look at the sun directly, the photons entering your eyes are mostly those unscattered ones that transmit directly through the atmosphere, and they are mostly longer-wavelength photons.

By then water molecules are also similarly small, so why would water look so different from the air?
It is because water molecules are very densely packed, so their scatterings are coherent.
In fact, the end result of such coherent scatterings by a collection of water molecules is that water appears specular.

The photopigments in a photoreceptor are very small in size compared to the wavelengths of visible light (each rhodopsin has a cross-section area of about \SI{1e-2}{\nano\meter\squared} [@milo2015cell, p. 144]), so they almost do not scatter lights at all, only absorption.
That is why we could use microspectrophotometry (MSP) to measure a photoreceptor's (transverse) absorption rate (@sec-chpt-hvs-receptor-absorb-msp): MSP measures the amount of light transmitted through a photoreceptor, and if there is little scattering, then all the photons that are not measured must be absorbed by the photoreceptor.

Scattering in the small-particle regime is also called **Rayleigh scattering**, which, again, is *not* somehow a fundamentally different scattering process, and the Rayleigh scattering theory^[worked out by Lord Rayleigh, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1904] is nothing more than a special case of the Mie scattering theory [@sharma2003color, Chpt. 3.5.1; @bohren2006fundamentals. Chpt. 3.2].

The phase function in the Rayleigh regime is proportional to $1+\cos^2\theta$,
so the backward and forward scatterings are roughly equally probable.
Taking the phase function into account, the scattering efficiency (in the form defined in @eq-sca_eff_phase) in Rayleigh scattering is proportional to:

$$
\begin{align}
    Q_s \propto (\frac{r}{\lambda_m})^4 \frac{m^2-1}{m^2+2} (1 + \cos^2\theta).
\end{align}
$$

#### Impact of Particle Size

When the particle size increases, the scattering efficiency increases, initially very quickly, but eventually saturates.
In fact, the Mie theory predicts that when the particle size is much larger than the wavelength (e.g., more than 100 times larger), the scattering efficiency approaches a constant 2 regardless of $m$ and $\lambda_m$ [@johnsen2012optics, Fig. 5.4].
This is evident in @fig-scattering_efficiency_m, which shows the scattering efficiency of a kind of particle as a function of particle radius ($x$-axis) under different $m$ (different curves); the incident light wavelength is 500 nm.

![Scattering efficiency as a function of particle radius under different relative refractive index $m$; the incident light wavelength is 500~nm. From @johnsen2012optics[Fig. 5.4].](figs/scattering_efficiency_m){#fig-scattering_efficiency_m width="80%"}

The particle size also affects the phase function.
As we have discussed above, small particles in the Rayleigh regime tend to scatter photons equally in the forward and backward directions, while large particles primarily scatter photons in the forward directions.
The last two graphs in @fig-phase_function show the phase functions predicted by the Mie scattering theory under different particle sizes (both are larger than that in the Rayleigh regime).
The forward fraction increases as the particle size increases.

Consider the scenario in @fig-photon_particle_interactions, where Material~1~ sits on top of Material~2~, and our goal is to hide Material 2 so that the color of Material 1 is dependent only on the illumination (not the property of Material 2).
There is an interesting trade-off between scattering efficiency and scattering direction here.
If we want Material 1 to hide Material 2, we want the particles in Material 1 to scatter a lot of light (high scattering efficiency) backwards.
If the scattering efficiency is low (so photons march on and are hindered only by absorption) or the scattering is heavy in the forward directions, photons penetrate through Material 1 and reach Material 2, which would then contribute to the overall color.

Now, to scatter a lot of light, we need the particles to be large, but then the scattering will be mostly in the forward directions.
So there exists a sweet spot of the particle size that provides the highest "hiding power" for a material per unit volume.
If we work out the math, we will see that the sweet spot falls roughly in the visible wavelength range.
That is why most paint pigments have a diameter between 100 nm and \SI{1}{\micro\metre} [@paintpigmentsize].
Of course, no matter how poor the hiding power is for a particular paint, if you apply enough of it, it will eventually hide whatever is behind it.
Dye pigments are rather small in size (nm range), so they scatter few photons and that is why dye solutions look relatively transparent.

#### Impact of Refractive Index

@fig-scattering_efficiency_m also shows the impact of the relative refractive index $m$ (between the particle and the surrounding media) on scattering efficiency.
Generally, the scattering efficiency increases with $m$ at all particle sizes until when the particles are so large that the scattering efficiency becomes a constant.
This is supported by @eq-mie_1, too ($\frac{m^2-1}{m^2+2}$ monotonically increases and has a limit of 1).

For large particles, while $m$ does not affect the scattering efficiency, it influences the scattering directions.
When $m$ is small, the scattering tends to be more forward, whereas when $m$ is large, the scattering tends to be toward large angles (i.e., more photons will be back-scattered).
This is why wet objects look darker (recall the unpleasant experience of accidentally spilling water on your pants).
In dry paints, the medium surrounding the textile particles is air, and in wet paints it is water.
$m$ becomes smaller when the material is wet (i.e., the relative refractive-index difference becomes smaller between the textile particles and water), so most of the scattering will be forward, increasing the traversal length of photons and essentially giving photons more opportunities to be absorbed.

#### Aspherical Particles

What if the particle is not spherical?
The Mie theory does not apply.
Analytical or even numerical solutions to the Maxwell's equations would be difficult, so perhaps a better approach is just to parameterize a model and fit it with the experimental data.

One popular one-parameter parameterization of the phase function is the **Henyey–Greenstein** phase function [@pharr2018physically, Chpt. 11.3.1; @bohren2006fundamentals, Chpt. 6.3.2], which takes the form:

$$
\begin{align}
    p(\theta) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{1-g^2}{(1+g^2-2g\cos\theta)^{3/2}},
\end{align}
$$

where $g$ is the free parameter and is usually called the \textbf{asymmetry parameter}.

We hasten to emphasize that the Henyey–Greenstein function has absolutely zero physical meaning; it is designed for fitting experimental phase function data, so in the modern deep learning era, you might as well try a deep neural network.
The second graph in @fig-phase_function shows one instantiation of the Henyey–Greenstein function.

## Radiative Transfer Equation and Volume Rendering {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte}

So far we have assumed that a ray can only be attenuated, which can happen only when the illumination is collimated and we assume single scattering.
Under this assumption, @eq-scat_cont allows us to calculate any radiance in the medium (by weakening the initial radiance).
General media are much more complicated: illumination can be from anywhere, and multiple scattering must be accounted for.
As a result, external photons can be scattered into a ray of interest, as we have intuitively discussed in @sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-intuition.

In the realm of geometric optics and radiometry, the general way to model lights going through a material/medium amounts to solving the so-called **Radiative Transfer Equation** (RTE), whose modern version was established by @chandrasekhar1960radiative^[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1983 (not for the RTE).], and @kajiya1984ray was the first to introduce it to computer graphics.
The RTE provides a mathematical way to express an arbitrary radiance in a medium.

### Radiative Transfer Equation {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-rte}

The basic idea is to set up a differential equation to describe the (rate) of the radiance *change*.
Given an incident radiance $L(p, \os)$, we are interested in $L(p+\D s \os, \os)$, the radiance after the ray has gone a small distance $\D s$.
The radiance can be:

* attenuated by the medium because of absorption;
* attenuated by the medium because photons are scattered out into other directions; this is called \textbf{out-scattering} in graphics;
* augmented by photons that are scattered into the ray direction from all other directions --- because of multiple scattering^[Technically, even single scattering can lead to augmentation if there is illumination coming from anywhere outside the ray direction.]; this is called *in-scattering* in graphics;
* augmented because particles can emit photons.

The attenuation (reduction) of the radiance over $\D s$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
    -L(p, \os) \sigma_t(p, \os) \D s.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-radiance_sub}

The radiance augmentation due to in-scattering is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
    \int^{\Omega = 4\pi} f_p(p, \os, \oi) \sigma_s(p, \os) \D s L(\oi) \doi = \sigma_s(p, \os) \D s \int^{\Omega = 4\pi} L(p, \oi) f_p(p, \os, \oi) \doi.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-radiance_add_insca}

<!-- %\fixme{different oi will have different optical length, but that can be folded into sigma. the fact that we are integrating over 4pi means we should absolutely consider photons that hit all six faces of the cube. also recall that we considering single scattering, so a scattered photon will not go through other scatterings in that volume/entire medium.} -->

The way to interpret @eq-radiance_add is the following.
$L(p, \oi)$ is the incident radiance from a direction $\oi$, $L(p, \oi) \doi$ is the irradiance received from $\doi$, of which $\sigma_s(p, \oi)\D s L(p, \os) \doi$ is the irradiance scattered in all directions after traveling a distance $\D s$.
That portion of the scattered irradiance is multiplied by $f_p(\os, \oi)$ to give us the radiance toward $\os$ (see @eq-phase_func_def2).
We then integrate over the entire sphere, accounting for the fact that lights can come from anywhere over the space, to obtain the total augmented radiance toward $\os$.

If we consider emission, the total radiance augmentation is:

$$
\begin{align}
    \sigma_a(p, \os) \D s L_e(p, \os) + \sigma_s(p, \os) \D s \int^{\Omega = 4\pi} L(p, \oi) f_p(p, \os, \oi) \doi,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-radiance_add_total}

where $L_e(p, \os)$ is the emitted radiance at $p$ toward $\os$, so the first term represents the total emission over $\D s$.
If we let:

$$
\begin{align}
    L_s(p, \os) = \sigma_a(p, \os) L_e(p, \os) + \sigma_s(p, \os) \int^{\Omega = 4\pi} L(p, \oi) f_p(p, \os, \oi) \doi,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-source_term_em}

the total augmentation can be simplified to:

$$
\begin{align}
    L_s(p, \os) \D s,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-radiance_add}

where the $L_s$ term is sometimes called the **source term** or **source function** in computer graphics, because it is the source of power at $p$\footnote{Some definitions do not include emission in the source term, while in other definitions the source term is what is defined here divided by $\sigma_t$.}.

Combining @eq-radiance_sub and @eq-radiance_add, the net radiance change is\footnote{A subtlety you might have noticed is that not all the out-scattering of $L(p, \os)$ attenuates the radiance; some of the scattering could be toward $\os$ so should augment the radiance.
This is not a concern since our augmentation term \Eqn{eq:radiance_add} integrates over the entire sphere, so it considers $L(p, \os)$ again as part of in-scattering and accounts for the forward-scattered portion of $L(p, \os)$.}:

$$
\begin{align}
    \D L(p, \os) &= L(p + \D s \os, \os) - L(p, \os) \\
    &= -L(p, \os) \sigma_t(p, \os) \D s + L_s(p, \os) \D s.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-rte_1}

As $\D s$ approaches 0, we get (assuming $\os$ is a unit vector as in @eq-abs_cont and @eq-scat_cont):

$$
\begin{align}
    \os \cdot \nabla_p L(p, \os) &= \frac{\d L(p, \os)}{\d s} = \lim_{\D s \rightarrow 0} \frac{L(p + \D s \os, \os) - L(p, \os)}{\D s} \nonumber \\
    &= -\sigma_t(p, \os) L(p, \os) + L_s(p, \os),
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-rte_2}

where $\nabla_p$ denotes the gradient of $L$ with respect to $p$, and $\os \cdot \nabla_p$ denotes the directional derivative, which is used because technically $p$ and $\os$ are both defined in a three-dimensional space, so what we are really calculating is the rate of radiance change at $p$ along $\os$.

@eq-rte_2 is the RTE, which is an integro-differential equation, because it is a differential equation with an integral embedded.
The RTE has an intuitive interpretation: if we think of radiance as the power of a ray, as a ray propagates, its power is attenuated by the medium but also augmented by "stray photons" from other rays.
The latter is given by $L_s(p, \os)$, which can be thought of as the augmentation of the radiance per unit length.

The RTE describes the rate of change of an arbitrary radiance $L(p, \os)$.
But our ultimate goal is to calculate the radiance itself?
Generally the RTE has no analytical solution.
There are two strategies to solve it.
First, we can derive analytical solutions under certain certain assumptions and simplifications.

* For instance, the integral in @eq-rte_2 can be approximated by a summation along $N$ directions;
then we can turn @eq-rte_2 into a system of $N$ differential equations to be solved.
This is sometimes called the **N-flux theory**.
We will omit a formal treatment but refer you to @bohren2006fundamentals[Chpt. 6.1], @volz2001industrial[Chpt. 3.1.2], and @klein2010industrial[Chpt. 5.5] for details.
You might have heard of the famous Kubelka-Munk model [@kubelka1931beitrag; @kubelka1931article; @kubelka1948new] widely used in modeling the color of pigment mixture; it is essentially a special case of the N-flux theory where $N=2$, which we will discuss in @sec-chpt-mat-vs-km.

* Another assumption people make is to assume that volume scattering is isotropic and can be approximated as a *diffusion* process.
This is called the **diffusion approximation** [@ishimaru1977theory; @ishimaru1978wave], which is widely used in both scientific modeling [@farrell1992diffusion; @eason1978theory; @schweiger1995finite; @boas2001imaging] and in rendering [@stam1995multiple, Chpt. 7; @wann2001practical; @dong2013material]; see @bohren2006fundamentals[Chpt. 6.2] for a theoretical treatment.

The second approach deserves its own section.

### Volume Rendering Equation {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-vre}

The second approach, which is particularly popular in computer graphics, is to first turn the RTE into a purely integral equation and then *numerically* (rather than analytically) estimate the integral using Monte Carlo integration, very similar to how the rendering equation is dealt with for surface scattering (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-re).

![(a): Illustration of the continuous VRE (@eq-vre). (b): Illustration of a discrete VRE (@eq-vre_1a), where the integral in the continuous VRE is replaced by a summation between $p_0$ and $p$ at an interval of $\D s$; $t_i$ is the total transmittance between $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$; $L_i$ is a shorthand for $L_s(p_i, \os)$, the source term of at $p_i$ toward $\os$.](figs/vre){#fig-vre width="100%"}

The way to think of this is that in order to calculate any given radiance $L(p, \os)$, we need to integrate all the changes along the direction $\os$ up until $p$.
Where do we start the integration?
We can start anywhere.
@fig-vre (a) visualizes the integration process.
Let's say we want to start from a point $p_0$, whose initial radiance toward $\os$ is $L_0(p_0, \os)$.
Let $p = p_0 + s\os$, where $\os$ is a unit vector and $s$ is the distance between $p_0$ and $p$.
An arbitrary point $p'$ between $p_0$ and $p$ would then be $p' = p_0 + s' \os$^[There are two alternative parameterizations, both of which are common in graphics literature.
The first [@pharr2023physically] is to express $p_0 = p + s\os$ ($s$ being positive), but then the initial radiance would have to be expressed as $L(p_0, -\os)$, since $\os$ now points from $p$ to $p_0$.
The other is to express $p_0 = p - s\os$ ($s$ again being positive) [@fong2017production]; this avoids the need to switch directions but uses a negative sign.
It is a matter of taste which one to use, but be alert to the different conventions.].

Now we need to integrate from $p_0$ to $p$ by running $s'$ from 0 to $s$.
Observe that the RTE is a form of a \textit{non-homogeneous} linear differential equation, whose solution is firmly established in calculus.
Without going through the derivations, its solution is:

$$
\begin{align}
    L(p, \os) = T(p_0 \rightarrow p)L_0(p_0, \os) + \int_{0}^{s} T(p' \rightarrow p) L_s(p', \os)\d s',
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre}

where $T(p_0 \rightarrow p)$ is the transmittance between $p_0$ and $p$ along $\os$, and $T(p' \rightarrow p)$ is the transmittance between $p'$ and $p$ along $\os$.
Recall the definition of transmittance in @eq-transmittance: it is the remaining fraction of the radiance after attenuation by the medium after traveling the distance between two points.
In our case here:

$$
\begin{align}
    T(p' \rightarrow p) = \frac{L(p+s\os, \os)}{L(p+s'\os, \os)} = e^{-\int_{s'}^s \sigma_t(p+t\omega, \omega) \d t}, \\
    T(p_0 \rightarrow p) = \frac{L(p+s\os, \os)}{L(p, \os)} = e^{-\int_{0}^s \sigma_t(p+t\omega, \omega) \d t},
\end{align}
$$

The integral equation @eq-vre in the graphics literature is called the **volume rendering equation** (VRE) or the **volumetric light transport equation** --- the counterpart of the surface LTE (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-re).
Looking at the visualization in @fig-vre (a), the VRE has an intuitive interpretation: the radiance at $p$ along $\os$ is the the contribution of $p_0$ plus and contribution of every single point between $p_0$ and $p$.

* The contribution of $p_0$ is given by its initial radiance $L_0$ weakened by the transmittance between $p_0$ and $p$;
* Why would a point $p'$ between $p_0$ and $p$ make any contribution?  It is because of the source term (@eq-source_term_em): $p'$ might emit lights, and some of the in-scattered photons at $p'$ will be scattered toward $\os$.  The contribution of $p'$ is thus given by the source term $L_s$ weakened by the transmittance between $p'$ and $p$.

The form of the VRE might appear to suggest that it is enough to accumulate along only the *direct* path between $p_0$ and $p$, which is surprising given that there are infinitely many scattering paths between $p_0$ and $p$ (due to multiple scattering).
For instance, it appears that we consider only the outgoing radiance toward $\os$ from $p_0$, but $p_0$ might have outgoing radiances over other directions, which might eventually contribute to $L(p, \os)$ through multiple scattering.
Are we ignoring them?

The answer is that the VRE *implicitly* accounts for all the potential paths between $p_0$ and $p$ because of the $L_s$ term, which expands to \Eqn{eq:source_term_em}.
That is, every time we accumulate the contribution of a point between $p_0$ and $p$, we have to consider the in-scattering from all the directions at that point.
Another way to interpret this is to observe that the radiance term $L$ appears on both sides of the equation.
Therefore, the VRE must be solved recursively by evaluating it everywhere in space.

Does this remind you of the rendering equation (@eq-re)?
Indeed, the VRE can be thought of as the volumetric counterpart of the rendering equation.
Similarly, we can use Monte Carlo integration to estimate it, just like how the rendering equation is dealt with --- with an extra complication: the VRE has two integrals: the outer integral runs from $p_0$ to $p$ and, for any intermediate point $p'$, there is an inner integral that runs from $p'$ to $p$ to evaluate the transmittance $T(p' \rightarrow p)$.
Therefore, we have to sample both integrands.

Similar to the situation of the rendering equation, sampling recursively would exponentially increase the number of rays to be tracked.
Put it another way, since there are infinitely many paths from which a ray gains its energy due to multiple scattering, we have to integrate infinitely many paths.
Again, a common solution is path tracing, for which @pharr2023physically[Chpt. 14] is a great reference.

A simplification that is commonly used is to assume that there is only single scattering directly from the light source.
In this way, the $L_s$ term does not have to integrate infinitely many incident rays over the sphere but only a fixed amount of rays emitted from the light source *non-recursively*.
This strategy is sometimes called **local illumination** in volume rendering, as opposed to **global illumination**, where one needs to consider all the possible paths of light transport.
The distinction is similar to that in modeling surface scattering (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-re).

### Discrete VRE and Scientific Volume Visualization {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-vis}

Sometimes the VRE takes the following discrete form:

$$
\begin{align}
    L = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(L_i\D s\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}t_j\big).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre_1a}

@eq-vre_1a is the discrete version of @eq-vre: the former turns the two integrals in the latter (both the outer integral and the inner one carried by $T(\cdot)$) to discrete summations using the Riemann sum over $N$ discrete points along the ray between $p_0$ and $p$ at an interval of $\D s = \frac{s}{N}$.

The notations are slightly different; @fig-vre (b) visualizes how this discrete VRE is expressed with the new notations.

* $L$ is $L(p, \os)$, the quantity to be calculated;
* $L_i$ is a shorthand for $L_s(p_i, \os)$, i.e., the source term (@eq-source_term_em) for the $i^{th}$ point between $p_0$ and $p$ toward $\os$; by definition, $p_0$ is the $0^{th}$ point (so $L_0$ is the initial radiance $L_0(p_0, \os)$ in @eq-vre) and $p$ is the $N^{th}$ point;
* $t_i$ (or more explicitly $t(p_{i} \rightarrow p_{i+1})$) represents the total transmittance between the $i^{th}$ and the $(i+1)^{th}$ point and is given by $e^{-\sigma_t(p_i, \os) \D s}$ (notice the integral in continuous transmittance @eq-transmittance is gone, because we assume the transmittance between two adjacent points is a constant in the Reimann sum);
* $\alpha_i$ is the **opacity** between the $i^{th}$ and the $(i+1)^{th}$ point, which is defined as the residual of the transmittance between the two points: $1-t_i$.

See @max1995optical[Sect. 4] or @kaufman2003volume[Sect. 6.1] for a relatively straightforward derivation of @eq-vre_1a, but hopefully this form of the VRE is equally intuitive to interpret from @fig-vre (b).
It is nothing more than accumulating the contribution of each point\footnote{technically the contribution of each small segment between two discrete points because of the Reimann sum.} along the ray, but now we also need to accumulate the attenuation along the way just because of how opacity is defined by convention (per step), hence the product of a sequence of the opacity residuals.

We can also re-express @eq-vre_1a using opacity rather than transmittance:
$$
\begin{align}
    L &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(L_i\D s\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j)\big) \\
    &= L_{N-1} \D s + L_{N-2} \D s(1-\alpha_{N-1}) + L_{N-3} \D s(1-\alpha_{N-1})(1-\alpha_{N-2}) +~\cdots~  \\
    &~~~+ L_1\D s\prod_{j=2}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j)+ L_0\D s\prod_{j=1}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j).
\end{align}
$$  {#eq-vre_1b}

The discrete VRE is usually used in the scientific visualization literature, where people are interested in visualizing data obtained from, e.g., computer tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
There, it is the relative color that people usually care about, not the physical quantity such as the radiance, so people sometimes lump $L_i\D s$ together as $C_i$ and call it the "color" of the $i^{th}$ point.
The VRE is then written as:

$$
\begin{align}
    C = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(C_i\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j)\big).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre_2}

The $C$ terms are defined in a three-dimensional RGB space, and @eq-vre_2 is evaluated for the three channels separately, similar to how @eq-vre_1a and @eq-vre are meant to be evaluated for each wavelength independently.
Since color is a linear projection from the spectral radiance, the so-calculated $C$ (all three channels) is indeed proportional to the true color, although in visualization one usually does not care about the true colors anyway (see @sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-vis-vis).

@eq-vre_2 is also called the *back-to-front* compositing formula in volume rendering, since it starts from $p_0$, the farthest point on the ray to $p$.
We can easily turn the order around to start from $p$ and end at $p_0$ in a *front-to-back* fashion ($C_{N-1}$ now corresponds to $p_0$):

$$
\begin{align}
    C = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(C_i\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}t_j\big).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre2_front}

While theoretically equivalent, the latter is better in practice because it allows us to opportunistically terminate the integration early when, for instance, the accumulated opacity is high enough (transmittance is low enough), at which point integrating further makes little numerical contribution to the result.

#### Another Discrete Form of VRE

A perhaps more common way to express the discrete VRE is to approximate the transmittance $t$ using the first two terms of its Taylor series expansion and further assume that the medium has a low albedo, i.e., $\sigma_t \approx \sigma_a$ and $\sigma_s \approx 0$ (that is, the medium emits and absorbs *only*); we have:

$$
\begin{align}
    & 1 - \alpha_i = t_i = t(p_{i} \rightarrow p_{i+1}) = e^{-\sigma_t(p_i, \os) \D s} = 1 - \sigma_t(p_i, \os) \D s + \frac{(\sigma_t(p_i, \os) \D s)^2}{2} - \cdots \\
    \approx & 1 - \sigma_t(p_i, \os) \D s \\
    \approx & 1 - \sigma_a(p_i, \os) \D s.
\end{align}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha_i \approx \sigma_a(p_i, \os) \D s.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre_alpha_approx}

Now, observe that the $L_i$ term in @eq-vre_1a is the source term in @eq-source_term_em, which under the low albedo assumption has only the emission term, so:

$$
\begin{align}
\label{eq:vre_3}
    L &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(L_i\D s\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j)\big) \\
    &=  \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(\sigma_a(p_i, \os) L_e(p_i, \os)\D s\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j)\big).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre_3b}

Now plug in @eq-vre_alpha_approx, we have:

$$
\begin{align}
    L =  \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(L_e(p_i, \os)\alpha_i\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j)\big).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre_3c}

If we let $C_i = L_e(p_i, \os)$, the discrete VRE is then expressed as [@levoy1988display]:

$$
\begin{align}
    C = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(C_i\alpha_i\prod_{j=i+1}^{N-1}(1-\alpha_j)\big).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre_4}

This can be interpreted as a form of **alpha blending** [@smith1995alpha], a typical trick in graphics to render transparent materials.
It makes sense for our discrete VRE to reduce to alpha blending: our derivation assumes that the volume does not scatter lights, so translucent materials become transparent.

Again, @eq-vre_4 is the back-to-front equation, and the front-to-back counterpart looks like:

$$
\begin{align}
    C = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\big(C_i\alpha_i\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}t_j\big).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-vre4_front}

If you compare the two discrete forms in @eq-vre_2 and @eq-vre_4, it would appear that the two are not mutually consistent!
Of course we know why: 1) @eq-vre_4 applies two further approximations (low albedo and Taylor series expansion) *and* 2) the two $C$ terms in the two equations refer to different physical quantities (compare @eq-vre_1b with @eq-vre_3c).

#### The Second Form is More Flexible {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-vis-compare}

What is the benefit of this new discrete form, comparing @eq-vre2_front and @eq-vre4_front?
Both equations can be interpreted as a form of weighted sum, where $C_i$ is weighted by a weight $w_i$, which is $\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}t_j$ in the first case and $\alpha_i\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}t_j$ in the second case.
The most obvious difference is that the weights in the first case are correlated but less so in the second case.
The weights are strictly decreasing as $i$ increases in the first case, since $t_i < 1$.

In the second case, the weights are technically independent.
One way to understand this is to observe, in the second case, that $w_0 = \alpha_0$ and $w_{i+1} = w_i \frac{\alpha_{i+1}(1-\alpha_i)}{\alpha_i}$, so there is generally a unique assignment of the $\alpha$ values for a given weight combination.
This "flexibility" will come in handy when we can manually assign (@sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-vis-vis) or learn the weights (@sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-nr).
Note, however, that if we impose the constraint that $\alpha\in[0, 1]$, we are effectively constraining the weights too.

#### Visualization is Not (Necessarily) Physically-Based Rendering! {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-vis-vis}

These discrete VRE forms might give you the false impression that we have avoided the need to integrate infinitely many paths, because, computationally, the evaluation of the VRE comes down to a *single-path* summation along the ray trajectory.
Not really.
Calculating the $C_i$ terms in the new formulations still requires recursion if the results are meant to be physically accurate.
Of course we can sidestep this by, e.g., applying the local-illumination approximation, as mentioned before, to avoid recursion.

Scientific visualization offers another opportunity: we can simply *assign* values to the $C$s and even the $\alpha$s without regard to physics.
The goal of visualization is to discover/highlight interesting objects and structures while de-emphasizing things that are irrelevant.
So the actual colors are not as important, which gives us great latitude to determine VRE parameters.

![Comparing volume rendering for visualization and rendering. (a): two examples of scientific visualization (of CT data) using volume rendering; from @ctscan and @ctscanmouse. (b): photorealistic volume rendering (a scene from Disney’s Moana, 2016); from @eelt_rendering.](figs/render_vs_vis_new){#fig-render_vs_vis width="100%"}

@fig-render_vs_vis compares volume-rendered images for scientific visualization (a) and for photorealistic rendering (b).
In the case of visualization, the data were from CT scans.
In both scans, the outer surface is not transparent but is rendered so just because we are interested in seeing the inner structures that are otherwise occluded.
The user makes an executive call to assign a very low transparency to the bones in the knee model 0 but a very high transparency value to the skin and other tissues: this is not physically accurate but a good choice for this particular visualization.
Photorealistic rendering, in contrast, has to be physically based and does not usually have this flexibility.
See figures in @wrenninge2011production and @fong2017production for more examples.

There is volume rendering software that would allow the users to make such an assignment depending on what the user wants to highlight and visualize.
With certain constraints and heuristics, one can also procedurally assign the $\alpha$ and $C$ values from the raw measurement data, usually a density field (see below) acquired from whatever measurement device is used (e.g., CT scanners or MRI machines), using what is called the *transfer functions* in the literature^[Some (color) transfer functions could have physical underpinnings, such as applying a single-scattering shading algorithms (i.e., local illumination); see, e.g., @levoy1988display[Sect. 3] or @max1995optical[Sect. 5], but the goal there is not to precisely model physics but for better, subjective visualization.].
Making an assignment usually is tied to a *classification* problem: voxels/points of different classes should have different assignments.

#### Density Fields

Physically speaking, the medium in RTE/VRE is parameterized by its absorption and scattering coefficients, which are a product of cross section and concentration, which is sometimes also called the density.
In physically-based volume rendering, this is indeed how the density is used from the very beginning [@kajiya1984ray; @blinn1982light].

In visualization where being physically accurate or photorealistic is unimportant, the notion of an attenuation coefficient\footnote{which is the only coefficient needed and which participates in calculating $\alpha$ (@eq-vre_2).} loses its physical meaning; it is just a number that controls how the brightness of a point weakens.
People simply call the attenuation coefficient the density [@kaufman2003volume], presumably because, intuitively, if the particle density is high the color should be dimmer.
If you want to be pedantic, you might say that the attenuation coefficient depends not only on the density/concentration but also on the cross section (@eq-abs_2), so how can we do that?
Remember in visualization one gets to make an executive call and *assign* the density value (and thus control $\alpha$), so it does not really matter if the value itself means the physical quantity of density/concentration.
This is apparent in early work that uses volume rendering for scientific visualization [@sabella1988rendering; @williams1992volume], where attenuation coefficients are nowhere to be found.

For this reason, the raw volume data obtained from raw measurement device for scientific (medical) visualization are most often called the density field, even though what is being measured is almost certainly not the density field but a field of optical properties that are related to, but certainly do not equate, density.
For instance, the raw data you get from a CT scanner is actually a grid of attenuation coefficients [@bharath2009introductory, Chpt. 3].

### Discrete VRE in (Neural) Radiance-Field Rendering {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-nr}

There is another field where the discrete VRE (especially our second form @eq-vre_4) is becoming incredibly popular: (neural) radiance-field rendering.
The two most representative examples are NeRF [@mildenhall2021nerf] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [@kerbl20233d].
They are fundamentally image-based rendering or light-field rendering (@sec-chpt-mat-basics-radiometry-lf), where they sample the light field of the scene by taking a set of images at different camera poses and learn to reconstruct the underlying light field, from which they can then re-sample a new camera pose and, thus, render the corresponding image as if it was taken at that new camera pose.
This is re-branded in the modern era as "novel view synthesis".

We will assume that you have read the two papers above so that we can focus on interpreting these radiance-field methods within the fundamental framework of physically-based rendering.
Such a re-interpretation would allow us to better understand where these methods come from, how they have introduced new tweaks to physically-based rendering, and what their limitations might be.

The first thing to notice is that NeRF and 3DGS, being essentially a sampling and reconstruction method, use the discrete form of the VRE (mostly @eq-vre_4) as the reconstruction function.
This means they assume that the radiance is calculated by a single-path summation along the ray trajectory without the need for path tracing and solving the actual RTE/VRE.
The reason they can reduce infinite paths to a single-path evaluation is very similar to that in scientific visualization, except now instead of assigning the "color" values $C$ and opacity values $\alpha$ (or equivalently the density field as discussed above), they train a neural network to directly learn these values.

#### VRE for Surface Rendering? {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-nr-why}

It is interesting to observe that both NeRF and 3DGS (and the vast majority of their later developments) use the discrete VRE form in @eq-vre_4 as their forward model and can evidently do a very good job at rendering opaque surfaces.
Is this surprising?
Isn't @eq-vre_4 designed to render transparent materials/volumes (alpha blending)?

For opaque surfaces, the "ground truth" is the surface rendering equation (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-re), which can be seen as a form of weighted sum, where the BRDF $f_r(p, \os, \oi)$ weighs the incident light irradiance $L(p, \oi) \cos\theta_i \text{d}\oi$.
In theory, the weights are independent of each other: the value of $f_r(p, \os, \oi)$ at different $\oi$ can technically be completely uncorrelated.
But in reality they are most likely somewhat correlated for real materials: the appearance of a material does not change dramatically when the incident light direction changes slightly.
For volumes/translucent materials, the "ground truth" is the VRE, which you could also say is a weighted sum, although the weights are constrained if the $\alpha$ values are constrained (e.g., between 0 and 1), which is the case in NeRF and 3DGS training (@sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-vis-compare).

So effectively, when rendering opaque surfaces, we are using a form of (theoretically) constrained weighted sum to approximate another (practically) constrained weighted sum, and we hope that we can learn the approximation from a large amount of offline samples.
The learned parameters (color and opacity of each point) should not be interpreted literally in the physical sense.
One advantage of this parameterization is that it *could* be used to render volumes or translucent materials if needed, where the ground truth *is* the VRE, in which case the learned parameters might be more amenable to physical interpretations.

#### Volume Graphics vs. Point-Based Graphics

Related to volume graphics, there is also a subtly different branch of graphics called **point-based graphics** (PBG) [@levoy1985use; @gross2011point].
The boundary is somewhat blurred, but given the way the two terms are usually used, we can observe a few similarities and distinctions.
Both volume graphics and PBG use discrete points as the rendering primitives (as opposed to continuous surfaces such as a mesh), although the input points in volume graphics are usually placed on uniform grids [@engel2004real, Chpt. 1.5.2] whereas points in PBG can be spatially arbitrary.

Traditionally, PBG is almost exclusively used for photorealistic rendering of surfaces.
In fact, the points used in PBG are usually acquired as samples on continuous surfaces [@gross2011point, Chpt. 3].
PBG usually uses object-order rendering through splatting, although ray casting is used too, but RTE/VRE is not involved in the rendering process [@gross2011point, Chpt. 6].

In contrast, the use of volume graphics is much broader.
Volume rendering can be used for photorealistic rendering of participating media and translucent surfaces (by solving the RTE/VRE), or it can be used for non-photorealistic data visualization (by evaluating the single-path, discrete VRE), at which point whether the object to be rendered is called a participating medium, a translucent surface, or anything else is irrelevant, because visualization does not care much about being physically accurate.

3DGS is a somewhat interesting case.
It is largely a form of PBG because the rendering primitives are unaligned surface samples, and its splatting technique (which we will discuss shortly) resembles that developed in the PBG literature [@gross2011point, Chpt. 6.1].
However, 3DGS does use the discrete VRE as the forward model.
Again, as discussed just above, VRE is just a way for 3DGS to parameterize its forward mode, so the comparison with traditional volume graphics and PBG should not be taken literally.

#### Splatting is Signal Filtering {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-nr-splatting}

Splatting, initially proposed by @westover1990footprint for visualizing volume data, is a common rendering technique used in PBG and 3DGS-family models.
We discuss what splatting is, why it works, and how it is used in NeRF and 3DGS.
We start by asking: how can we render continuous surfaces from discrete points?
If we directly project the points to the sensor plane, we obviously will get holes, as shown in @fig-splatting (a).
This is, of course, not an issue if the rendering primitives are meshes (or procedurally-generated surfaces).

![(a): directly projecting discrete points to the image plane would create holes in the rendered image. (b): in splatting, each point is associated with a splat or a footprint function, which can distribute the color of the point to a spatial region on the image plane. (c): splatting essentially allows signal interpolation, which amounts to first reconstructing the underlying signal from the samples (with potential anti-aliasing filtering) followed by re-sampling at new, desired positions.](figs/splatting_new.png){#fig-splatting width="70%"}

The key is to realize that "meshless" does not mean surfaceless: the fact that we do not have a mesh as the rendering primitives does not mean the surface does not exist.
Recall that the points used by PBG are actually samples on the surface.
To render an image pixel is essentially to estimate the color of a surface point that projects to the pixel (ignoring supersampling for now).
From a signal processing perspective, this is a classic problem of signal filtering: reconstruction and resampling.

That is, ideally what we need to do is to reconstruct the underlying signal, i.e., the color distribution of the continuous surface^[assuming a diffuse surface so we care to reconstruct the color of each point, not the radiance of each ray.] (combined with an anti-aliasing pre-filter^[The compound filter combining reconstruction and anti-aliasing filters is sometimes also called a resampling filter, because the compound filter is used during resampling to calculate the new sample values.]) and then resample the reconstructed/filtered signal at positions corresponding to pixels in an image.
This is shown in @fig-splatting (c).
%This amounts to applying a single composite filter $F$ at new sampling positions, and
The name of the game is to design proper filters.
The issue of signal sampling, reconstruction, and resampling is absolutely fundamental to all forms of photorealistic rendering and not limited to PBG; @pharr2023physically[Chpt. 8] and @glassner1995principles[Unit II] are great references.

Another way to think of this is that the color of a surface point is very likely related to its nearby points that have been sampled as part of the rendering input, so one straightforward thing to do is to interpolate from those samples to calculate colors of new surface points.
Signal interpolation is essentially signal filtering/convolution.

There is one catch.
In classic signal sampling theories (think of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem), samples are uniformly taken and, as a result, we can use a single reconstruction filter.
But in PBG the surface samples are non-uniformly taken, so a single reconstruction filter would not work.
Instead, we need a different filter for each point.
The filter in the PBG parlance is called a *splat*, or a *footprint function*;
it is associated with each point (surface sample) and essentially distributes the point color to a local region, enabling signal interpolation.
This is shown in @fig-splatting (b).
The exact forms of the footprint functions would determine the exact forms of the signal filters.
Gaussian filters are particularly common, and Gaussian splatting is a splatting method that uses Gaussian filters [@greene1986creating; @heckbert1989fundamentals; @zwicker2001surface].

From a 3D modeling perspective, instead of having a continuous mesh, the scene is now represented by a set of discrete points, each of which is represented by a 2D Gaussian distribution, which is called a surface element or a surfel [@pfister2000surfels].
Each surfel is then projected to the screen space to generate a splat as the corresponding reconstruction kernel of that surface point; the reconstruction kernel, after projection, is another Gaussian filter (which can be cascaded with an anti-aliasing pre-filter).
The color of each screen space point is then calculated by summing over all the splats (each of which is, of course, scaled by the color of the sample), essentially taking a weighted sum of the colors of the neighboring surface samples (see @zwicker2001surface[Fig. 3] for a visualization) or, in signal processing parlance, resampling the reconstructed signal with the reconstruction kernels.

This rendering process is traditionally called surface splatting [@zwicker2001surface].
@yifan2019differentiable is an early attempt to learn the surfels through a differential surface splatting process.
Surface splatting is a reasonable rendering model in PBG: the "ground truth" in rendering surfaces is the rendering equation, which can also be interpreted as a weighted sum.

One can also apply the same splatting idea to volume rendering.
In this case, each point in the scene is represented by a 3D Gaussian distribution, which is projected to a 2D splat in the screen space.
The color of a pixel is then calculated through, critically, alpha blending the corresponding splats, not weighted sum.
This is called volume splatting [@zwicker2001ewa].
3DGS can be seen as a differential variant of traditional volume splatting, even though it is also very effective in rendering opaque surfaces (and we have discussed the reason on @sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-nr-why).

### Integrating Surface Scattering with Volume Scattering {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-bssrdf}

The rendering equation governs the surface scattering or light transport in space, and the RTE/VRE governs the volume/subsurface scattering or light transport in a medium.
Both processes can be involved in a real-life scene.
For instance, the appearance of a translucent material like a paint or a wax is a combination of both forms of scattering/light transport (@fig-photon_particle_interactions).
Another example would be rendering smoke against a wall.

<!-- %https://pbr-book.org/4ed/Light_Transport_II_Volume_Rendering/Volume_Scattering_Integrators -->
Conceptually nothing new needs to be introduced to deal with the two forms of light transport together.
Say we have an opaque surface (a wall) located with a volume (smoke) in the scene.
If we want to calculate the radiance of a ray leaving a point on the wall, we would evaluate the rendering equation there, and for each incident ray, we might have to evaluate the VRE since that ray might come from the volume.
In practice it amounts to extending the path tracing algorithm to account for the fact that a path might go through a volume and bounce off between surface points.
See @pharr2023physically[Chpt. 14.2] and @fong2017production[Sect. 3] for detailed discussions.

Another approach, which is perhaps more common when dealing with translucent materials (whose appearance, of course, depends on both the surface and subsurface scattering), is through a phenomenological model based on the notion of Bidirectional Scattering Surface Reflectance Distribution Function (**BSSRDF**) [@nicodemus1977geometrical].
The BSSRDF is parameterized as $f_s(p_s, \os, p_i, \oi)$, describing the infinitesimal outgoing radiance at $p_s$ toward $\os$ given the infinitesimal power incident on $p_i$ from the direction $\oi$:

$$
\begin{align}
    f_s(p_s, \os, p_i, \oi) = \frac{\text{d}L(p_s, \os)}{\text{d}\Phi(p_i, \oi)}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-bssrdf}

BSSRDF can be seen as an extension of BRDF in that it considers the possibility that the radiance of a ray leaving $p_s$ could be influenced by a ray incident on another point $p_i$ due to SSS/volume scattering.
Given the BSSRDF, the rendering equation can be generalized to:

$$
\begin{align}
    L(p_o, \os) = \int^A\int^{\Omega=2\pi} f_s(p_s, \os, p_i, \oi) L(p_i, \oi) \cos\theta_i \doi \d A,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-re_sss}

where $L(p_o, \os)$ is the outgoing radiance at $p_o$ toward $\os$, $L(p_i, \oi)$ is the incident radiance at $p_i$ from $\oi$, $A$ in the outer integral is the surface area that is under illumination, and $\Omega=2\pi$ means that each surface point receives illumination from the entire hemisphere.

We can again use path tracing and Monte Carlo integration to evaluate @eq-re_sss if we know the BSSRDF, which can, again, either be analytically derived given certain constraints and assumptions or measured [@frisvad2020survey].
To analytically derive it, one has to consider the fact that the transfer of energy from an incident ray to an outgoing ray is the consequence of a cascade of three factors: two surface scattering (refraction) factors, one entering the material surface $p_i$ from $\oi$ and the other leaving the material surface at $p_i$ toward $p_o$, and a volume scattering factor that accounts for the subsurface scattering between the incident ray at $p_i$ and the exiting ray at $p_o$ [@pharr2018physically, Chpt. 11.4].
If all three factors have an analytical form, the final BSSRDF has an analytical form too.
This is the approach that, for instance, @wann2001practical takes.

## The Kubelka–Munk Model {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-km}

As discussed in @sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-rte, the general RTE is difficult to solve, and there are two general strategies.
@sec-chpt-mat-vs-rte-rte discusses one strategy that numerically approximates the solution using Monte Carlo methods.
Another common strategy is to make some simplified assumptions and/or apply additional constraints, which would allow us to derive analytical solutions.
This section discusses perhaps the most aggressive form of simplification that, nevertheless, is very widely used, especially in the printing, painting, and dye industry (and to some extent in graphics).

Kubelka and Munk, two Czechoslovakian chemists, built a phenomenological model that estimates the spectral reflectance/transmittance of a material [@kubelka1931beitrag; @kubelka1931article; @kubelka1948new].
Their model cares only about the hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-reflectance), i.e., the ratio of total flux scattered upward to the hemisphere to the total toward flux incident from the hemisphere.
The K-M model also considers that the material under modeling is in immediate contact with a *Lambertian* substrate that reflects light uniformly over all directions.
This is a common scenario in scenarios such as paints on a canvas, dyes on textiles, printer inks on paper, coatings on films, etc.

<!-- %\fixme{diffuse assumption is technically wrong; use Fig. 2.5 in Bohren and the light absorption into a tube.} -->

We will go through an excruciatingly long derivation, but the intuitions behind the derivation are exactly the same as that of the RTE, because the K-M model is a simplification of the RTE.
The derivation allows us to make clear what simplifications we have made and, thus, when the model is and is not applicable.

### Deriving the Model {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-km-derivation}

@fig-km_model illustrates the setup that we will use to derive the model.
The first important assumption that the K-M model makes is that the every point on the material surface receives exactly the same irradiance and that the material itself is homogeneous, consisting of particles that are statistically randomly distributed and oriented.
As a result, there is no difference between different positions at the same depth anywhere inside the material.
Of course the radiation fields at different depths are different; at the very least, the deeper you go, the fewer photons there are due to absorption.
Another way to think of this is that we are intentionally limiting our consideration to only a small area where there is no spatial difference at the same depth, so we can analyze information only at different depths rather than different positions at the same depth.

![The setup of deriving the K-M model. We focus on the change of downward irradiance ($E_{\downarrow}$) and upward irradiance ($E_{\uparrow}$) as they travel a thin layer $\D x$. We make the assumption that the material is an isotropic medium and is homogeneous spatially.](figs/km_model){#fig-km_model width="70%"}

We focus on a very thin layer $\D x$; since there are no differences between horizontal positions, we can arbitrarily pick a point at depth $0 \leq x \leq X$ for analysis, where $X$ is the total depth (the material surface has $x=0$ and the material bottom has $x=X$).
The point at $x$ receives photons from all directions.
Let's say all the downward photons (going to the lower hemisphere) have a total irradiance of $E_{\downarrow}(x)$ and all the upward photons (going to the upper hemisphere) have a total irradiance of $E_{\uparrow}(x)$.
The (hemispherical-hemispherical) reflectance at $x$ is then the ratio of the two:

$$
\begin{align}
    R(x) = \frac{E_{\uparrow}(x)}{E_{\downarrow}(x)},
\end{align}
$$

and the reflectance at the material surface (which is what the K-M model is interested in calculating) is $R(0)$.

How do we express $E_{\downarrow}(x)$?
As usual, we set a differential equation to describe the change of $E_{\downarrow}(x)$.
Consider the following conservation of energy when $E_{\downarrow}(x)$ goes through the thin layer $\D x$:

$$
\begin{align}
    E_{\downarrow}(x + \D x) - E_{\downarrow}(x) = & - \int^{S^2_+}\sigma_a(x, \omega) \D x L(x, \omega) \do \label{eq:km_down_1} \\
    & - \int^{S^2_+}\int^{S^2_+}\sigma_s(x, \omega) f_p(x, \omega', \omega) \D x L(x, \omega) \do' \do \label{eq:km_down_2} \\
    & + \int^{S^2_-}\int^{S^2_-}\sigma_s(x + \D x, \omega) f_p(x + \D x, \omega', \omega) \D x L(x + \D x, \omega) \do' \do,  \label{eq:km_down_3}
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_raw}

where $S^2_+$ and $S^2_-$ represent the upper and lower hemispheres, respectively; $L(x, \omega)$ is the radiance coming from direction $\omega$ incident on a point of depth $x$, $f_p(x, \omega', \omega)$ is the phase function between the incident direction $\omega$ and outgoing direction $\omega'$, and $\sigma_s(x, \omega)$ is the scattering coefficient at $x$ for an incident direction $\omega$ (@sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single).

The interpretation of this equation is exactly the same as that of the RTE.
The equation essentially says that the downward irradiance after traveling $\D x$ is (omitting emission):

* reduced by absorption (the first negative term in @eq-km_raw), which is the absorption component in the RTE;
* reduced by upward scattering (the second negative term in @eq-km_raw), which is the out-scattering component in the RTE;
* increased by the downward-scattering of upward irradiance reaching the bottom of the thin layer (the positive term in @eq-km_raw), which is the in-scattering component in RTE.

Now let's take a closer look at the absorption term in @eq-km_raw and re-write it:

$$
\begin{align}
    \int^{S^2_+}\sigma_a(x, \omega) \D x L(x, \omega) \do = \sigma_a(x, \bar{\omega}) \D x \int^{S^2_+} L(x, \omega) \do.
\end{align}
$$  {#eq-km_s_2}

@eq-km_s_2 is derived based on the **mean-value theorem**^[which says that there exists $c\in [a, b]$ such that $\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\d x = f(c)\int_a^b g(x)\d x$, if $g(x)$ is integrable and does not change its sign in $[a, b]$.] in integral calculus, which says that there exists *some* value of $\bar{\omega}\in S^2_+$ that would allow us to take the $\sigma_a$ term out of the integral.
Once we do that, the integral on the right-hand side of @eq-km_s_2 is simply the total downward irradiance, which we denote $E_{\downarrow}(x)$.

If we further assume that the material absorption is isotropic, then $\sigma_a(x, \bar{\omega})$ is independent of $\bar{\omega}$ and is simply a function of $x$, so we write it as $K_{\downarrow}(x)$, which allows us to re-write @eq-km_s_2 as:

$$
\begin{align}
    \int^{S^2_+}\sigma_a(x, \omega) \D x L(x, \omega) \do = K_{\downarrow}(x) \D x E_{\downarrow}(x).
\end{align}
$$  {#eq-km_s_3}

$K_{\downarrow}(x)$ is a phenomenological coefficient, but it is related to the fundamental absorption coefficient $\sigma_a$ and, thus, carries physical meanings.
This is clear from @eq-km_s_4:

$$
\begin{align}
    K_{\downarrow}(x) = \frac{\int^{S^2_+}\sigma_a(x, \omega) L(x, \omega) \do}{\D x E_{\downarrow}(x)}.
\end{align}
$$  {#eq-km_s_4}

$K_{\downarrow}(x)$, by definition, represents the fraction of downward irradiance that is absorbed per unit length.
Therefore, $K_{\downarrow}(x)$ can be intuitively interpreted as the effective *downward absorption coefficient* at depth $x$.
Note that while the mean-value theorem tells us that *some* $\bar{\omega}\in S^2_+$ exists, it does not tell us what its values is.
In reality, $K_{\downarrow}(x)$ will very much depend on $L(x, \omega)$.

Similarly, we can rewrite the upward scattering term in @eq-km_raw by first rearranging the terms:

$$
\begin{align}
    &\int^{S^2_+}\int^{S^2_+}\sigma_s(x, \omega) f_p(x, \omega', \omega) \D x L(x, \omega) \do' \do \\
    = &\int^{S^2_+}\Big(\int^{S^2_+}\sigma_s(x, \omega) f_p(x, \omega', \omega) \do'\Big) \D x L(x, \omega) \do.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_ku_1b}

We then invoke the mean-value theorem again, which says that there exists $\bar{\omega}\in S^2_+$ that allows us to write the upward scattering term as:

$$
\begin{align}
    (\int^{S^2_+}\sigma_s(x, \bar{\omega}) f_p(x, \omega', \bar{\omega}) \do' \D x) \int^{S^2_+}L(x, \omega) \do.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_ku_2}

We use $S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$ to denote the first integral in @eq-km_ku_2: $S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x) = \int^{S^2_+}\sigma_s(x, \bar{\omega}) f_p(x, \omega', \bar{\omega}) \do'$, which means the upward scattering term can be simplied to:

$$
\begin{align}
    S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x) \D x E_{\downarrow}(x).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_ku_3}

Combining @eq-km_ku_1b and @eq-km_ku_3, we get:
$$
\begin{align}
    S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x) = & \frac{\int^{S^2_+}\int^{S^2_+}\sigma_s(x, \omega) f_p(x, \omega', \omega) L(x, \omega) \do' \do}{\D x E_{\downarrow}(x)}.
\end{align}
$$  {#eq-km_ku_4}

$S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$ is again a phenomenological coefficient that is related to the fundamental scattering coefficient.
Its physical interpretation is clear from @eq-km_ku_4: it is the fraction of the downward irradiance that is scattered upward per unit length.
We can think of it as the effective "upward scattering coefficient of the downward irradiance".

Finally, we can do the same thing to the downward scattering term in @eq-km_raw:

$$
\begin{align}
    \int^{S^2_-}\int^{S^2_-}\sigma_s(x + \D x, \omega) f_p(x + \D x, \omega', \omega) \D x L(x + \D x, \omega) \do' \do
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_kd_1}

by first invoking the mean-value theorem and re-express it as:

$$
\begin{align}
    (\int^{S^2_-}\sigma_s(x + \D x, \hat{\omega}) f_p(x + \D x, \omega', \hat{\omega}) \do' \D x) \int^{S^2_-}L(x + \D x, \omega) \do.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_kd_2}

We use $S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x)$ to denote the first integral in @eq-km_kd_2.
The second integral in @eq-km_kd_2 is essentially the total upward irradiance at the depth $x+\D x$, which we denote $E_{\uparrow}(x + \D x)$.
Therefore, the downward scattering term becomes:

$$
\begin{align}
    S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x + \D x) \D x E_{\uparrow}(x + \D x).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_kd_3}

Combining @eq-km_kd_1 and @eq-km_kd_3, we have:

$$
\begin{align}
    S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x + \D x) = & \frac{\int^{S^2_-}\int^{S^2_-}\sigma_s(x + \D x, \omega) f_p(x + \D x, \omega', \omega) \D x L(x + \D x, \omega) \do' \do}{\D x E_{\uparrow}(x + \D x)},\\
    S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) = & \frac{\int^{S^2_-}\int^{S^2_-}\sigma_s(x, \omega) f_p(x, \omega', \omega) \D x L(x, \omega) \do' \do}{\D x E_{\uparrow}(x)}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_kd_5}

Now plug @eq-km_s_3, @eq-km_ku_3, and @eq-km_kd_3 back into @eq-km_raw, we get:

$$
\begin{align}
    E_{\downarrow}(x + \D x) = E_{\downarrow}(x) - K_{\downarrow}(x) \D x E_{\downarrow}(x) - S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x) \D x E_{\downarrow}(x) + S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x + \D x) \D x E_{\uparrow}(x + \D x).
\end{align}
$$

Rewrite it and take the limit as $\D x \rightarrow 0$:

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{E_{\downarrow}(x + \D x) - E_{\downarrow}(x)}{\D x} &= - K_{\downarrow}(x) E_{\downarrow}(x) - S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x) E_{\downarrow}(x) + S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x + \D x) E_{\uparrow}(x + \D x),\\
    \frac{\d E_{\downarrow}(x)}{\d x} &= - K_{\downarrow}(x) E_{\downarrow}(x) - S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x) E_{\downarrow}(x) + S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) E_{\uparrow}(x).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_down}

Similarly we can express the rate of change of the upward irradiance $E_{\uparrow}(x)$ based on the same energy conservation constraint:

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\d E_{\uparrow}(x)}{\d x} &= K_{\uparrow}(x) E_{\uparrow}(x) + S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) E_{\uparrow}(x) - S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x) E_{\downarrow}(x),
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_up}

where the three terms on the right-hand side, again, represent the absorption, out-scattering, and in-scattering in the original RTE.

Now a few more assumptions.
If we assume that the material absorption is isotropic (the total absorption per unit length is invariant to incident light direction over the entire sphere), we have $K_{\uparrow}(x) = K_{\downarrow}(x)$ because:

$$
\begin{align}
    K_{\uparrow}(x) = \sigma_a(x, \hat{\omega}) = \sigma_a(x, \bar{\omega}) = K_{\downarrow}(x),
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_abs_approx}

for some $\hat{\omega} \in S^2_-$ and $\bar{\omega} \in S^2_+$.

If we further assume that 1) the material is an isotropic scattering medium, then $\sigma_s(x, \omega)$ is invariant to $\omega$ (the total amount of scattering per unit length does not change with the incident light direction over the entire sphere), and 2) the particles are also isotropic scatters (which theoretically do not exist), then $f_p(x, \omega', \omega)$ is a constant ($\frac{1}{4\pi}$).
Therefore, $S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) = S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$, because:

$$
\begin{align}
    S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) &= \int^{S^2_-}\sigma_s(x, \hat{\omega}) f_p(x, \omega', \hat{\omega}) \do' \\
    &= \sigma_s(x, \hat{\omega}) \int^{S^2_-}f_p(x, \omega', \hat{\omega}) \do' = \sigma_s(x, \hat{\omega})/2 \\
    &= \sigma_s(x, \bar{\omega}) \int^{S^2_-}f_p(x, \omega', \bar{\omega}) \do' = \sigma_s(x, \bar{\omega})/2 \\
    &= S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x),
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_sca_approx}

for some $\hat{\omega} \in S^2_-$ and $\bar{\omega} \in S^2_+$.

A few notes on the assumptions here:

* The assumption of isotropic scatters is important; assuming only an isotropic medium is not enough.
This is because the integrals in \Eqn{eq:km_sca_approx} integrate only the upper (or lower) hemisphere rather than the entire sphere, so if the phase function itself is not a constant, the integral result will still depend on $\bar{\omega}$ or $\hat{\omega}$.
See the distinction between an isotropic medium and an isotropic scatter on @sec-chpt-mat-vs-sca-single-pf-iso.
* Alternatively, if the particles are not isotropic scatters, $S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) = S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$ can still hold if we assume that the upward and downward irradiance are both diffuse, i.e., the radiance $L(x, \omega)$ is invariant to $\omega$.
The isotropic medium assumption still needs to hold.
This can be proven by going back to the respective definitions of $S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x)$ and $S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$ in @eq-km_ku_4 and @eq-km_kd_5^[If $L(x, \omega)$ is invariant to $\omega$ and $f_p(x, \omega', \hat{\omega})$, under the isotropic medium assumption, is reduced to $f_p(x, \theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle subtended by $\omega$ and $\omega'$, both $S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x)$ and $S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$ are essentially calculating $\int^{\pi}\int^{\pi}c~\d \theta\d \theta'$.].
Interestingly, if the particles are isotropic scatters, the outgoing irradiance will necessarily be diffuse.
* Yet another way for $S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) = S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$ to hold is if we are considering a very idealized scenario where photons travel and are scattered only upward or downward [@bohren2006fundamentals, Chpt. 5.2].
If the medium is also isotropic (but does not have to consist of isotropic scatters), the fraction of the upward irradiance turned downward would be the same as the fraction of the downward irradiance turned upward, so $S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) = S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$.

Finally, given the assumption that the material is spatially homogeneous, both $\sigma_a$, $\sigma_s$, and $f_p$ are all independent of $x$.
Therefore, we can denote $K = K_{\uparrow}(x) = K_{\downarrow}(x)$ and $S = S_{\uparrow\downarrow}(x) = S_{\downarrow\uparrow}(x)$.
$K$ and $S$ are simply called the absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively, of the medium, but we now should know that they are of the phenomenological nature and, with all the simplifications above, are derived from the fundamental optical absorption/scattering properties of the medium (see @eq-km_abs_approx and @eq-km_sca_approx).

Now we combine @eq-km_down and @eq-km_up and get to the famous pair of differential equations underlying the K-M model:

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\d E_{\downarrow}(x)}{\d x} &= - (K +S)E_{\downarrow}(x) + S E_{\uparrow}(x), \\
    \frac{\d E_{\uparrow}(x)}{\d x} &= (K + S)E_{\uparrow}(x) - S E_{\downarrow}(x).
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km_diff}

### The Model and Its Interpretation {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-km-model}

@eq-km_diff gives us a pair of linear differential equations.
What we are interested in solving for is $R(0) = \frac{E_{\uparrow}(0)}{E_{\downarrow}(0)}$.
The boundary condition is that $R(X) = R_g$, which is the (assumed-to-be) known reflectance of the substrate.
Solving the differential equations gives us:

$$
\begin{align}
    & R(0) = \frac{E_{\uparrow}(0)}{E_{\downarrow}(0)} = \frac{1-R_g[a-b\coth(bSX)]}{a-R_g+b\coth(bSX)},\\
    & T(X) = \frac{E_{\downarrow}(X)}{E_{\downarrow}(0)} = \frac{b}{a\sinh(bSX)+b\cosh(bSX)},\\
    & a = \frac{K+S}{S},\\
    & b = \sqrt{a^2-1},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-km}

where $R(0)$ is the hemispherical-hemispherical reflectance at the material surface and $T(X)$ is the hemispherical-hemispherical transmittance at the bottom of the material^[You can see that $T(X)$ does not involve $R_g$: when we calculate the transmittance of the material, we assume that there is no substrate.]; $\coth(\cdot)$ is the hyperbolic cotangent function, $\sinh(\cdot)$ is the hyperbolic sine function, and $\cosh(\cdot)$ is the hyperbolic cosine function.
Note that we omit $\lambda$ for simplicity but keep in mind that $R(0), T(X), S, K, R_g, a, b$ are all spectral quantities.

@eq-km is the famous K-M model.
Consider the case where the material is purely absorptive and scatters little (e.g., dyes on textiles or fabrics), so $S$ is close to 0 and the reflectance is simplified to:

$$
\begin{align}
    R(0) = R_g e^{-2KX} = e^{-KX} R_g e^{-KX}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-kmabs}

We can understand $R_X$ by decomposing it into the product of three terms, each representing a step in the overall, observed reflection.
First, photons go through the material from the top down, being absorbed as they go.
The percentage of photons that are still left (i.e., unabsorbed) just before they hit the substrate is $e^{-KX}$, which is consistent with the Beer-Lambert law.
Second, the substrate reflects $R_g$ amount of light back toward the material.
Finally, as the photons make their way back to the surface, they go through another round of absorption governed by the same Beer-Lambert law (@sec-chpt-mat-vs-abs-simple).

Now consider the case where there is no substrate or when the substrate is a perfect black substrate; in both cases $R_g = 0$.
Reflectance is now:

$$
\begin{align}
    R_{black} = \frac{1}{a+b\coth(bSX)}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-black}

Finally, consider the case where the material is so thick that no photon reaches the substrate.
In this case, the reflectance is not affected by the substrate and can be simplified to (by letting $X$ approach infinity):

$$
\begin{align}
    \lim_{X \rightarrow \infty} = R_{\infty} = \frac{1}{a+b} = 1 + \frac{K}{S} - \sqrt{\Big(\frac{K}{S}\Big)^2 + 2 \frac{K}{S}}.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-hide}

In the painting industry, we say the paint's "hiding is complete" when the substrate does not influence the material color.
We can quantify the "hiding power" of a paint by $H = \frac{R_{white}}{R_{black}}$, i.e., the ratio of reflectance between when the substrate is black (absorbs everything) and white (reflects everything back).
If the hiding is complete, $H$ would be 1.

You might be wondering how we know $K$ and $S$ of a material --- we measure them.
For instance, observe @eq-black and @eq-hide; we can measure the reflectance $R_{black}$ when the substrate is nearly black and the reflectance $R_{\infty}$ when the hiding is near complete.
We can then solve the system of equations to estimate $K$ and $S$.

You can see that we are not actually taking a very thin layer of particles, illuminating it, and then measuring how much of the light is scattered vs. absorbed.
Instead, we estimate $K$ and $S$ macroscopically.
We have in mind a model (a set of equations or functions, if you will) that is parameterized by unknown variables.
We then probe the model by giving it different inputs and measuring the outputs.
From the input-output pairs, we can then estimate the unknown parameters.
This is why a model so defined and derived is called a phenomenological model and the parameters (e.g., the $K$ and $S$ coefficients) are called the phenomenological parameters --- because all we do is to observe the phenomena.

### K-M Model for Mixture of Materials {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-km-mix}

The basic K-M model can be extended to account for materials that consist of a mixture of materials, each with different absorption/scattering behaviors.
This is done by first expressing the overall absorption and scattering coefficients of the mixture and then plugging them into the K-M model.

Specifically, if we are mixing $N$ materials, each with a phenomenological absorption and scattering coefficient $K_i$ and $S_i$, the overall absorption and scattering coefficient of the material is:

$$
\begin{align}
    K &= \sum_{i=1}^N \eta_i K_i, \label{eq:ks_mix_k} \\
    S &= \sum_{i=1}^N \eta_i S_i, \label{eq:ks_mix_s}
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-ks_mix}

where $\eta_i$ is the *volume concentration* of the $i^{th}$ material in the overall material mixture and is defined as:

$$
\begin{align}
    \eta_i = \frac{V_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N V_j},
\end{align}
$$

where $V_j$ is the volume of the $j^{th}$ material.
Once we have the $K$ and $S$ coefficients, we simply invoke @eq-km to calculate the reflectance/transmittance of the material mixture.

Why would it make sense to calculate the overall $K$ and $S$ using the volume-weighting method in @eq-ks_mix?
Let's derive it using absorption as an example.
The overall absorption coefficient $K$ of the material mixture is also the optical absorption coefficient $\sigma_a$ of the mixture (given the set of assumptions we have made so far; see @eq-km_abs_approx), which is given by @eq-absorbances_add as:

$$
\begin{align}
    K = \sigma_a = \sum_i^N c^i\epsilon^i,
\end{align}
$$

where $c^i$ and $\epsilon^i$ are the number concentration and the absorption cross section of the $i^{th}$ material in the material mixture.
Specifically, $c^i$ is defined as:

$$
\begin{align}
    c^i = \frac{n_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N V_j} = \frac{V_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N V_j} \frac{n_i}{V_i},
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-num_conc}

where $n_i$ is the number of particles of the $i^{th}$ material in the mixture.
We assume that when we mix $N$ materials, their volumes add.
That is, the volume of the mixture is the sum of that of the individual materials.
This is in general true if different materials do not chemically react and if materials do not dissolve into each other.
Therefore:

$$
\begin{align}
    K = \sum_i^N c^i\epsilon^i \label{eq:k_mix_1} = \sum_i^N \frac{V_i}{\sum_{j=1}^N V_j} \frac{n_i}{V_i} \epsilon^i = \sum_i^N \eta_i \frac{n_i}{V_i} \epsilon^i.
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-k_mix_2}

We then, again, use the fact (@eq-km_abs_approx) that the phenomenological absorption coefficient of the $i^{th}$ material $K_i$ is the same as its optical absorption coefficient $\sigma_{a, i} = c_i \epsilon_i$, where:

* $c_i = \frac{n_i}{V_i}$ is the number concentration of the $i^{th}$ material *on its own* (note the subtle difference of $c_i$ here and $c^i$ in @eq-num_conc, which is the number concentration of the $i^{th}$ material in a mixture), and
* $\epsilon_i$ is just $\epsilon^i$: they both refer to absorption cross section of the $i^{th}$ material, which does not change whether the material is in a mixture or not.

Therefore:
$$
\begin{align}
    K = \sum_i^N \eta_i c_i \epsilon_i = \sum_i^N \eta_i K_i,
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-k_mix_3}

which is exactly @eq-ks_mix.

### N-Stream Model {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-km-nflux}

The basic K-M model is called the two-stream or two-flux model, because it considers only the total upward irradiance and total downward irradiance.
We basically have divided all the directions possible in the space into only two solid angles, the upper hemisphere and the lower hemisphere.
What if we want to know the irradiance at a finer granularity (i.e., over a smaller solid angle)?
We divide all the directions into more solid angles and analyze the irradiance change in them using a similar method.

For instance, if we now consider irradiance in four directions: $E_{\nwarrow}(x)$, $E_{\nearrow}(x)$, $E_{\searrow}(x)$, and $E_{\swarrow}(x)$, we can write the change of the irradiance in $E_{\searrow}(x)$ as:

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\d E_{\searrow}(x)}{\d x} = & - K_{\searrow}(x) E_{\searrow}(x) \nonumber \\
    & + S_{\nwarrow\searrow}(x) E_{\nwarrow}(x) + S_{\nearrow\searrow}(x) E_{\nearrow}(x) + S_{\swarrow\searrow}(x) E_{\swarrow}(x) \nonumber \\
    & - S_{\searrow\nwarrow}(x) E_{\searrow}(x) - S_{\searrow\nearrow}(x) E_{\searrow}(x) - S_{\searrow\swarrow}(x) E_{\searrow}(x),
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-n_stream_se}

where $S_{\nwarrow\searrow}$ is the scattering coefficient of from the northwest irradiance to the southeast direction, and so on.
We can express the changes of the other three directions similarly.
In general, if we divide the space into $N$ "channels", each representing a set of directions (a finite solid angle), we can extend the two-flux model to a "N-flux" model.

![The setup for the N-flux model. All the possible directions (consider all the arrows that can possibly go out from the origin) are divided into "channels" or "streams", each of which represents a finite solid angle within which an irradiance travels. The N-flux model models the changes of each of these irradiances. Adapted from @li2003ink[Fig. 4.1].](figs/n_flux){#fig-n_flux width="50%"}

@fig-n_flux shows the setup for deriving the N-flux model, where all the possible directions (consider all the arrows that can possibly go out from the origin) are divided into "channels" or "streams", each of which represents a finite solid angle within which an irradiance travels.
The figure visualizes eight such channels.
The change of each channel is modeled by taking away from each channel photons that are absorbed and scattered to all other channels and by adding photons scattered into the channel from all other channels.
In the end, we get $N$ linear differential equations.
@eq-n_stream_se is one such equation when $N=4$.
The channels are usually rotationally symmetric about the $z$-axis, assuming that the material is rotationally symmetric about the $z$-axis.

Comparing against the RTE in @eq-rte_2, which has an integral term $L_s$ given in @eq-source_term_em.
What the N-flux model does is to essentially approximate that integral with a finite sum.
In general, the larger the $N$ the better the approximation but also the more computationally intensive to solve.
We will omit a formal treatment but refer you to @bohren2006fundamentals[Chpt. 6.1], @volz2001industrial[Chpt. 3.1.2], and @klein2010industrial[Chpt. 5.5] for details.

### Correction for Surface Reflection {#sec-chpt-mat-vs-km-cor}

One thing that is ignored in the K-M model is the surface reflection/refraction yet.
Part of the photons will be reflected away at the air/material interface before they enter the material.
Similarly, when we consider the transmittance, we have ignored the reflection/refraction at the other side of the material.
So the reflectance and transmittance calculated by the K-M model are defined at the point when the photons are just about to leave the material.

To account for the surface phenomena, we can apply what is called the Saunderson correction, derived by @saunderson1942calculation.
See @sharma2003color[Chpt. 3.6.3] for a derivation, but briefly, if the illumination is diffuse, the corrected surface reflectance is:

$$
\begin{align}
    R = r_s + \frac{(1-r_s)(1-r_i)~R(0)}{1-r_i~R(0)},
\end{align}
$$

where $R(0)$ is the reflectance given by the K-M model, $r_s$ is the fraction of incident irradiance scattered by the air-material surface, and $r_i$ is the fraction of the internal irradiance approaching the air-material interface that is scattered back by the interface.
Assuming a smooth surface, both $r_s$ and $r_i$ can be calculated by the Fresnel equations given the refractive index of the material (@sec-chpt-mat-ss-mat).
