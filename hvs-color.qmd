# Color Vision {#sec-chpt-hvs-color}

This chapter studies color vision.
We will review two main retinal stages responsible for color vision: wavelength encoding by the photoreceptors and the opponent processes that take place post-receptorally.
We discuss both the behavioral phenomena as well as the potential neural and physiological basis.
That this chapter almost exclusively focuses on the retinal mechanisms should in no way be taken to imply that cortical mechanisms are insignificant to color vision.
We take this approach because: 1) the retinal mechanisms are much better understood and 2) many real-world applications such as color reproduction and detecting colored patterns could be adequately modeled by retinal mechanisms.
