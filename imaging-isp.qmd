# Image Signal Processing {#sec-chpt-imaging-isp}

This chapter reviews basics imaging signal processing algorithms.
The output of an image sensor is what we usually call the raw pixels.
The raw pixels are not the usual RGB images we are used to see.
For starters, if we use the common CFA approach for color sensing, each raw pixel has only one color channel response --- the two missing channel responses must be recovered.
We have also ignored noises, which are introduced every step along the signal transduction chain from incident lights to raw values.
Therefore, the raw pixels usually go through a post-processing pipeline before raw sensor can be consumed, whether it is by a human observer or, increasingly, machine vision algorithms.
