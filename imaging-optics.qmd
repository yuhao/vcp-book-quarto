# Imaging Optics {#sec-chpt-imaging-optics}

This chapter provides an introduction to imaging optics.
We start from the pinhole model; from its pros and cons, we motivate a lens-based imaging system.
We discuss important artifacts, a.k.a., aberrations, introduced by lenses that significantly impact the imaging quality.
Finally, we conclude with a computational model for modeling the image formation process carried out by optics.
The model provides a first-order approximation of the imaging quality and is widely used in various fields of visual computing.
